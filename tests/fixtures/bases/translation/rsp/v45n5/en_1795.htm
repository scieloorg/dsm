<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> 
  To estimate the prevalence of respiratory symptoms and to analyze associated 
  factors as well as peak expiratory flow measurements in schoolchildren.<br>
  <b>METHODS:</b> This is a descriptive cross-sectional study with schoolchildren 
  aged 10-14 from the city of Monte Apraz&iacute;vel (Southeastern Brazil). Questionnaires 
  containing the asthma and rhinitis components of the International Study of 
  Asthma and Allergies in Childhood were administered. The questionnaires also 
  approached sociodemographic characteristics, predisposing factors, and family 
  and personal medical history. Repeated measures of peak expiratory flow in the 
  children, and of black carbon and particulate matter (PM<sub>2,5</sub>) concentration 
  levels were carried out.<br>
  <b>RESULTS:</b> The prevalence of asthma and rhinitis symptoms was 11% and 33.2%, 
  respectively. Among asthmatic children, 10.6% presented four or more wheezing 
  attacks in the past 12 months. Past family history of bronchitis and rhinitis 
  was associated with presence of asthma (p=0.002 and p &lt;0.001) and rhinitis 
  (p &lt;0.001 and p&lt;0.001, respectively). Regarding rhinitis, there was association 
  with presence of mold or cracks on the house (p=0.009). Rhinitis was most frequent 
  from June to October, a period that matches the sugarcane harvest season. Daily 
  prevalence of peak expiratory flow below 20% of the median of each child's measurements 
  was higher in days with greater PM<sub>2,5</sub> concentration.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> The prevalence of asthma symptoms is below and that of rhinitis 
  is above the national average. Although within acceptable levels, pollution 
  in the cane trash burn season may contribute to the exacerbation of asthma and 
  rhinitis episodes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Respiratory diseases 
  are the second cause of hospitalization through the <i>Sistema &Uacute;nico 
  de Sa&uacute;de</i> (SUS - Brazil's National Health System) (13.6%): 1,541,113 
  hospitalizations in the entire country in 2006.<a name="topa"></a><a href="#backa">ª</a> 
  Asthma and rhinitis are considered the most common chronic diseases among children 
  and adolescents, and their prevalence has been increasing significantly. Therefore, 
  they have become a major public health problem.<sup>17</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Epidemiological 
  studies with children have shown great variation in their prevalence and symptoms. 
  Differences may derive from methodological problems, like the definition of 
  asthma symptoms, which are not specific,<sup>17</sup> and the diversity of the 
  utilized clinical expressions.<sup>21</sup> The International Study of Asthma 
  and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) was developed to standardize the methods 
  used in epidemiological studies, enabling to compare prevalences and the severity 
  of asthma, rhinitis and eczema across different cities and countries. The ISAAC 
  standardized questionnaire was translated and validated to the Portuguese language,<sup>22,25</sup> 
  and has been used in studies in Brazil.<sup>23</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Environmental factors 
  like urbanization and high population density may be considered important determinants 
  in the prevalences of asthma and rhinitis, as well as air pollution.<sup>19,24</sup> 
  Recent studies have associated exposure to air pollution with increase in asthma 
  incidence.<sup>11</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the pollutants 
  to which the population may be exposed, the gaseous ones, such as nitrogen dioxide 
  and ozone, and particulate matter (PM) have been associated with the increase 
  in mortality and hospital admission due to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, 
  in studies that have evaluated acute and also prolonged effects of pollutants.<sup>5,26</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The association 
  between environmental pollution caused by cane trash burn &#91;using total suspended 
  particles or PM (PM<sub>10</sub> or PM<sub>2,5</sub>) as markers&#93; and respiratory 
  morbidity showed an increase in the daily number of inhalations in the Emergency 
  Service<sup>1</sup> and an increase in hospitalizations due to respiratory problems.<sup>2,6</sup> 
  In an experimental study conducted with rats, exposure to PM collected in a 
  city with predominance of vehicle pollution and to sugarcane burning showed 
  that the respiratory outcomes were similar and in the biomass there was higher 
  presence of metals, especially iron and zinc.<sup>16</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The aim of the 
  present study was to estimate the prevalence of asthma and rhinitis symptoms 
  and to analyze associated factors, as well as peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements 
  in schoolchildren.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is a cross-sectional 
  study with 1,076 schoolchildren aged ten to 14 years, carried out in Monte Apraz&iacute;vel 
  (Southeastern Brazil) in 2007. The city had 19,745 inhabitants in this year 
  and low vehicle traffic. It has tropical climate and a dry and warm winter, 
  with annual average temperature of 23.4ºC. Sugarcane is the basis of the economy 
  (66% of the entire agricultural production). It is collected mainly manually, 
  after cane trash burn, from May to the beginning of December.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the city, there 
  were 1,214 children in the age group of interest, of whom 1,076 were enrolled 
  between the fifth and eighth grades in three schools (14.6% at a private school, 
  78.3% at a municipal school and 7.1% at a state school). Questionnaires and 
  consent documents were distributed in the classrooms and the students were instructed 
  to answer them together with their parents.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of the 1,076 students, 
  817 returned the questionnaires, with a response rate of 75.9%. Forty-five students 
  older than 14 years were excluded. Of the 772 analyzed questionnaires, 86.8% 
  came from the public schools and 13.3% from the private school.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The questionnaire 
  contained the asthma and rhinitis components of the questionnaire of the ISAAC 
  study, validated to the Portuguese language,<sup>22,25</sup> as well as questions 
  referring to sociodemographic characteristics, predisposing factors, and family 
  and personal past history of respiratory problems. The prevalence of current 
  asthma symptoms was estimated by the percentage of affirmative answers to the 
  question "Have you had wheezing or whistling in the chest in the past 12 months?". 
  The diagnosis of asthma was indirectly evaluated by the question: "Have you 
  ever had asthma?". The prevalence of rhinitis symptoms was estimated by the 
  frequency of affirmative answers to the question "Have you had a problem with 
  sneezing, or a runny, or blocked nose when you did not have a cold or the flu" 
  and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, by the question "In the past 12 months, has 
  this nose problem accompanied by itchy-watering eyes?".<sup>22,23,25</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A panel study was 
  carried out with 131 voluntary students of the municipal school, with 78% of 
  the students in the evaluated grades, and located in the central area of the 
  city. These students were submitted to serial measurements of peak expiratory 
  flow (PEF). The students were sent to the test by the teachers. An average of 
  43 students was evaluated per day, and they were recalled to repeat the test 
  every three days, up to ten measurements per student. The test was performed 
  at the beginning of the morning, from October to November (period of sugarcane 
  burning).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The PEF value was 
  obtained by means of Mini Wright Peak Flow Meter portable devices (Clemente 
  Clark International Ltd., London, England). The devices registered measures 
  from 60 to 850 L/min, with variation below 5% or 10L/min (whichever was higher). 
  Before reaching 80% of the number of measurements with calibration warranted 
  by the manufacturer, the device was replaced by another one. Each child, in 
  standing position and after maximum inhalation, exhaled strongly and quickly 
  in an individual disposable mouthpiece, under supervision. This was performed 
  three times, and the highest value was considered (in L/min).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The daily sampling 
  of the fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2,5</sub>) was performed with a sampler 
  developed by the Harvard School of Public Health, installed on the roof of the 
  municipal school's courtyard. This device functions at a flow of 10L/min. At 
  the initial part of the probe, an impaction system retains the particles whose 
  aerodynamic diameter is higher than 2.5 &#181;m (cutpoint PM<sub>2,5</sub>), 
  while the particles of interest, below 2.5 &#181;m, are collected in a filter 
  (polycarbonate membrane: 37 mm; pore: 0.8 &#181;m, Millipore&#174;) for laboratory 
  analysis. Sampling started in the morning. The exposed filter was replaced by 
  a clean one every 24 h and the process was reinitiated. In every replacement, 
  the sampling parameters were registered (filter identification, date, time, 
  hour meter indication, indication of the air volume totalizer and of the air 
  flow indicator).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The daily mean 
  concentration of PM<sub>2,5</sub> was obtained through a gravimetric method, 
  with sampled mass, by the difference in the filter's weight before and after 
  sampling, divided by the total volume of sampled air. The weighing of the filter 
  was performed at a laboratory with control of temperature (22<sup>&#186;</sup>C) 
  and relative humidity (45%), in an ultra-sensitive Mettler Toledo scale, model 
  UMX2, with accuracy of 1 &#181;g, using a portal for the elimination of electrostatic 
  charge. Black carbon concentration was estimated in each filter by reflectance 
  in a reflectometer with a tungsten lamp, model Smoke Stain Reflectometer, M43D 
  Diffusion System, with the aid of a calibration curve.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The laboratory 
  analysis and the processing of the calculations of PM<sub>2,5</sub> and black 
  carbon concentration were conducted in the facilities of the Experimental Air 
  Pollution Laboratory of the School of Medicine of <i>Universidade de S&atilde;o 
  Paulo</i> (USP), which is jointly run with the Astronomy, Geophysics and Air 
  Sciences Institute of USP. The daily temperature and humidity were measured 
  with the portable device Digital Thermohygrometer, model 970, Kiltler.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Descriptive statistics 
  of the data included number of measurements, frequencies, means and standard 
  deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum, for the environmental variables 
  and for the questions of the questionnaire. To each child, the median of his/her 
  PEF measures was calculated. The variation of the daily measurement was calculated 
  considering the median of the child's measures as reference (the individual 
  median was subtracted from the PEF measure on that day and the difference was 
  divided by the median). The daily prevalence of children with a PEF reduction 
  of at least 20% in relation to the median was calculated with the number of 
  children with PEF decrease divided by the total number of children evaluated 
  on that day.<sup>13</sup> The association between the daily PM<sub>2,5</sub> 
  concentrations and the daily prevalences of PEF decreases was evaluated. These 
  prevalences were categorized as zero prevalence (no child on that day with PEF 
  decrease), from 0.1% to 4.9% and equal to or higher than 5%. The comparisons 
  of the results were made with chi-square, Fisher, t-test, Mann-Whitney or ANOVA. 
  The limit for statistical significance that was considered was p &lt; 0.01 due 
  to the multiple comparisons.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The statistical 
  analysis used the computer application SPSS version 15.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study was approved 
  by the Research Ethics Committee of the School of Medicine of S&atilde;o Jos&eacute; 
  do Rio Preto (Process no. 5303/2007).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of the 772 participants, 
  53.3% were males, with mean age of 12.9 years (SD = 1.11), 48.6% were between 
  13 and 14 years of age and 92.5% lived in the urban zone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Symptoms of active 
  asthma had a prevalence of 11%. There was no difference in the prevalences of 
  wheezing ever in life and symptoms of active asthma between genders (<a href="../img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_1795t01.jpg">Table 
  1</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Higher frequencies 
  of history of another respiratory disease (47.5% vs. 16.7%, p &lt; 0.001) and 
  of hospitalization due to respiratory problems (30.2% vs. 10.8%, p &lt; 0.001) 
  were observed in children with asthma symptoms. No association was observed 
  between asthma and the studied predisposing factors (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_1795t02.jpg">Table 
  2</a>). Presence of bronchitis (p = 0.002) or rhinitis (p &lt; 0.001) in the 
  family presented association with asthma in the child.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The prevalence 
  of symptoms of current rhinitis (sneezes, runny nose or nasal obstruction with 
  no cold or flu in the past 12 months) was of 33.2%. There was no statistically 
  significant difference between rhinitis symptoms or its previous diagnosis and 
  gender (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_1795t01.jpg">Table 1</a>). <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_1795f01.jpg">Figure 
  1</a> shows the prevalence of rhinitis symptoms reported per month, in the past 
  12 months, in the studied population. It achieved the highest value from June 
  to September. Rhinitis was associated with the presence of cracks or mold on 
  the walls (p = 0.009) and with the presence of bronchitis (p &lt; 0.001), rhinitis 
  (p &lt; 0.001) or asthma (p = 0.008) in the family (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_1795t02.jpg">Table 
  2</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 131 students 
  who performed the PEF measurements were, on average, 12.7 years old (SD = 0.94), 
  51.8% were males and 94.5% lived in the urban zone. The comparison with the 
  641 students who did not participate in the panel study did not show differences 
  between these characteristics or between the prevalences of the symptoms of 
  asthma and rhinitis or of risk factors.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The PEF measurements 
  were performed in 25 school days, as there were many holidays in this period. 
  The students performed an average of 9.9 measurements (SD = 0.38), with a minimum 
  of seven and a maximum of ten. The PEF mean was 295 (SD = 54) L/min, varying 
  from 200 to 498 L/min.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The daily mean 
  prevalence of PEF measure at least 20% lower than the median of the results 
  of each student was 2.1%, varying from 0 to 6.5% in the diverse days of the 
  study.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the children 
  who had at least one PEF measure with a decrease of at least 20% of the value 
  of its median, none had current asthma and 38.1% presented rhinitis in the past 
  12 months.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There were problems 
  in PM<sub>2,5</sub> sampling or determination in eight days due to damage to 
  the filter or weighing flaws. The distribution of the daily mean concentration 
  of PM<sub>2,5</sub> was calculated for the 34 days with valid measures. There 
  were no losses in the measurements of the daily mean concentration of black 
  carbon, minimum and maximum temperature and minimum and maximum relative humidity 
  of air (<a href="#t3">Table 3</a>).</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In comparison with 
  the Brazilian national means,<sup>23</sup> the prevalence of symptoms of active 
  asthma in this study was lower (11% <i>vs</i>. 19%) and that of active rhinitis 
  was higher (33.2% <i>vs</i>. 29.6%) in adolescents aged 13 and 14 years. In 
  phase III of ISAAC,<sup>23</sup> the prevalences of asthma symptoms varied from 
  11.8% in Nova Igua&ccedil;u (Southeastern Brazil) to 30.5% in Vit&oacute;ria 
  da Conquista (Northeastern Brazil) and the rhinitis prevalences varied from 
  17.4% in Nova Igua&ccedil;u to 47% in Bel&eacute;m (Northern Brazil). The differences 
  in these prevalences are partly explained by environmental factors (like air 
  pollution), socioeconomic factors (like high population density and the basis 
  of the local economy, whether agricultural or industrial), and genetic factors, 
  like sensitivity to allergens.<sup>11,24</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The number of children 
  evaluated in the present study was lower than that of ISAAC (3,000 children), 
  due to the inexistence in the city of this number of adolescents in the recommended 
  age group. To compensate for it, the age group was amplified to 10-14 years. 
  The results for children aged 13 and 14 were presented separately to facilitate 
  comparison with other studies.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Measures of PM<sub>2,5</sub> 
  concentration in Monte Apraz&iacute;vel in October and November exceeded the 
  air quality standards established by the World Health Organization (25&#181;g/m<sup>3</sup>) 
  for daily mean in some days. A study carried out in Piracicaba<sup>6</sup> (Southeastern 
  Brazil) showed mean concentration of PM<sub>2,5</sub> of 22.8 &#181;g/m<sup>3</sup> 
  and 10 &#181;g/m<sup>3</sup> in the harvest and off-season periods, respectively. 
  In Araraquara (Southeastern Brazil), a city which is a large sugarcane producer, 
  data from <i>Companhia de Tecnologia de Saneamento Ambiental</i> (CETESB - Environmental 
  Sanitation Technology Company)<a name="topb"></a><a href="#backb"><sup>b</sup></a> 
  showed an important increase in total suspended particles and of PM<sub>10</sub> 
  in the period of sugarcane harvest, compared to the off-season period.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pollution caused 
  by biomass burn has been associated with higher number of hospital admissions 
  due to respiratory problems in children and the elderly,<sup>2,6</sup> as well 
  as vehicle pollution.<sup>10,26</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The effect of pollution 
  on asthma prevalence has been observed mainly with pollutants related to vehicle 
  traffic, especially carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide.<sup>12</sup> The prevalence 
  of symptoms of active asthma among adolescents has been directly related to 
  air pollution in the state of Rio de Janeiro.<sup>19</sup> In Monte Apraz&iacute;vel, 
  where there is little pollution caused by traffic, lower prevalence of symptoms 
  of active asthma has been observed compared to other urban centers studied in 
  Brazil.<sup>23</sup> In Nova Igua&ccedil;u, the prevalence of symptoms of active 
  asthma was similar to the one obtained in Monte Apraz&iacute;vel.<sup>14</sup> 
  Although it is the largest municipality of the region of Baixada Fluminense 
  and the second in terms of population, with high demographic density (1,449.60 
  inhab/km<sup>2</sup>), many of the researched schools were located at semi-rural 
  areas with low vehicle traffic.<sup>14</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the fact 
  that the prevalence of asthma symptoms in Monte Apraz&iacute;vel is among the 
  lowest levels when compared to other Brazilian cities, the frequency of four 
  or more crises in the last 12 months (10.6% overall or 8.7% in schoolchildren 
  aged 13 to 14 years) was higher than in other studies (of up to 3%).<sup>3,14</sup> 
  Even though there is no large temperature variation throughout the year in Monte 
  Apraz&iacute;vel, there is evidence of greater exacerbation of asthma, which 
  may derive from exposure to the pollution generated by sugarcane burning. Exposure 
  to particulate matter was associated with neutrophilic inflammation in airways 
  of healthy individuals, and was an important induction agent for asthma exacerbation. 
  This may derive from mechanisms associated with the inflammation, by adjuvant 
  effect of ultrafine particles.<sup>20</sup> Pollutants can aggravate asthma, 
  even in relatively moderate concentrations, as reported in a bibliographic review 
  about adverse effects of environmental pollutants.<sup>9</sup> In addition, 
  the transfer of children with non-treated mild asthma from a highly polluted 
  urban region to a rural one that is almost non-polluted showed an improvement 
  in the inflammation of the airways after one week, evaluated by reduction in 
  nasal eosinophils, and improvement in the lung function, evaluated by the increase 
  in PEF.<sup>18</sup> The frequency of rhinoconjunctivitis in Monte Apraz&iacute;vel 
  was higher than the one found in the majority of the cities evaluated in Brazil, 
  with a mean of 14.6%,<sup>23</sup> and higher number of episodes during the 
  period of sugarcane burning.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The effect of pollution 
  on PEF was estimated by the daily prevalence of measures below the median of 
  each child (a decrease of at least 20%), as suggested by Hoek et al.<sup>13</sup> 
  The variability of the measures of each child was evaluated by comparing with 
  the median of their own measures. In this way, the age, anthropometric and gender 
  effects that occur in the studied age group did not interfere in the analysis. 
  Although with no statistical significance, probably due to the small number 
  of evaluated days, pollution may have an acute effect on lung function, as the 
  daily prevalence of measures with PEF reduction increased as the mean concentration 
  of PM<sub>2,5</sub> and black carbon increased. The effects of the exposure 
  to air pollutants are reported even when their levels are low and it has not 
  been possible to establish a concentration threshold, below which there would 
  not be a harmful effect on people's health.<sup>5</sup> Thus, the evaluation 
  of daily exposure to environmental pollutant and of PEF measures showed that, 
  even with acceptable levels of pollutants in the majority of days, PM<sub>10</sub> 
  and NO<sub>2</sub> were associated with reduction in the lung function in children 
  who live in Rio de Janeiro.<sup>8</sup> The majority of the studies evaluates 
  the effect of the environmental pollution produced by traffic on health. <sup>5,9,12,26</sup> 
  In an experimental study, the single and low dose exposure to environmental 
  particles produced by traffic or by sugarcane burning induced to significant 
  alterations in mice, and the biomass particles were at least as toxic as those 
  produced by traffic. <sup>16</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The prevalence 
  of lifetime asthma is described as lower than that of current asthma.<sup>23</sup> 
  This finding is interpreted as a subdiagnosis of asthma, i.e., there are some 
  patients with asthma that is not diagnosed. In Monte Apraz&iacute;vel, prevalence 
  of lifetime asthma was higher than the prevalence of symptoms of current asthma. 
  As the present study included children aged ten to 14, the questionnaires were 
  answered by the parents, differently from other studies with children aged 13 
  to 14 years. It is possible that the parents have better memory than the adolescents 
  about previous diagnoses of asthma. However, in the validation of the questionnaire, 
  there was a significant agreement between the answers to the ISAAC questionnaire 
  of the adolescents and of their parents or guardians, although the parents tended 
  to underestimate the symptoms that have little interference in the adolescents' 
  daily activities.<sup>22</sup> On the other hand, there may be a difference 
  in the diagnosis of the healthcare services in diverse cities.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Higher prevalence 
  of asthma has been found in the female sex.<sup>7,15</sup> The difference observed 
  in the present study was not significant and may have occurred due to the lower 
  number of participants.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Asthma was not 
  associated with predisposing factors and personal history, a result that is 
  similar to the findings of another study.<sup>7</sup> On the other hand, Maia 
  et al<sup>15</sup> found an association with the presence of animals. This association 
  is difficult to detect, because the result depends on the duration and intensity 
  of the exposure to the animal, which varies if the animal stays in or out of 
  the house. The present study found an association between rhinitis and the presence 
  of cracks or mold on the walls.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Asthma and rhinitis 
  were associated with family history of bronchitis and rhinitis, which is in 
  accordance with evidences described for genetic factors and family history of 
  allergies in these conditions.<sup>11</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The seasonal variation 
  of the prevalence of rhinitis symptoms, like sneezes, runny nose or nasal obstruction, 
  without having a cold, in the past 12 months had higher percentage in the months 
  from June to September and the proportion of children who reported these symptoms 
  in Monte Apraz&iacute;vel was higher than the one reported in other studies.<sup>4</sup> 
  The increase observed in Monte Apraz&iacute;vel occurred during the sugarcane 
  harvest (April to November), consequently with the occurrence of burning outbreaks, 
  which may intensify the pollution levels in the city. This is also the period 
  of winter, which is warm and dry in Monte Apraz&iacute;vel, the period of lowest 
  rainfall index (annual mean rainfall of 113.47 mm, reaching 20 mm in July) and 
  of low air humidity (minimum of 10% during the harvest of 2007). These factors 
  hinder the dispersion of air pollutants and foster the emergence of respiratory 
  diseases.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The results of 
  the present study showed a prevalence of symptoms of asthma that is lower than 
  and of rhinitis that is comparable to the ones found in other cities in Brazil 
  that have vehicle pollution. Despite the small temperature variation during 
  the year, the results suggest greater exacerbation of asthma in Monte Apraz&iacute;vel. 
  The city does not have polluting factories and the traffic of vehicles is low, 
  which suggests that the pollution generated by sugarcane burning may influence 
  the occurrence and exacerbation of respiratory symptoms. To better evaluate 
  its role, it is necessary to measure in a continuous way the several pollutants 
  and to monitor the respiratory symptoms during the seasonal alterations and 
  in the periods of sugarcane harvest and off-season.</font></p>
