<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> 
  To evaluate the quality of information registered on fetal death certificates.<br>
  <b>METHODS: </b> Records were reviewed from 710 fetal deaths registered in the 
  consolidated database of deaths from the State System for Data Analysis and 
  the S&atilde;o Paulo State Secretary of Health, for deaths in S&atilde;o Paulo 
  municipality (Southeastern Brazil) during the first semester of 2008. Completeness 
  was analyzed for variables on fetal death certificates issued by hospitals and 
  autopsy service. The death certificates from a sub-sample of 212 fetal deaths 
  in hospitals of the National Unified Health System (public) were compared to 
  medical records and to the records from Coroner's Office.<br>
  <b>RESULTS: </b> Among death certificates, 75% were issues by Coroner's Office, 
  with Coroner's greater frequency in public hospitals (78%). Completeness of 
  variables on death certificates issued by hospitals was higher among non-public 
  hospitals. There was greater completeness, agreement and sensitivity in death 
  certificates issued by hospitals. There was low agreement and high specificity 
  for variables related to maternal characteristics. Increased reporting of gender, 
  birth weight and gestational age was observed in certificates issued by Coroner's 
  Office. Autopsies did not result in improved ascertainment of cause of death, 
  with 65.7% identified as unspecified fetal death as 24.3% as intrauterine hypoxia, 
  while death certificates by hospitals reported 18.1% as unspecified and 41.7% 
  as intrauterine hypoxia.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS: </b> Completeness and the ascertainment of cause of fetal death 
  need to be improved. The high proportion of autopsies did not improve information 
  and ascertainment of cause of death. The quality of information generated by 
  autopsies depends on access to hospital records.</font></p>

  Evaluar la calidad de la informaci&oacute;n registrada en las declaraciones 
  de &oacute;bito fetal.<br>
  <b>M&Eacute;TODOS: </b> Estudio documental con 710 &oacute;bitos fetales en 
  hospitales de Sao Paulo, Sureste de Brasil, en el primer semestre de 2008, registrados 
  en la base unificada de &oacute;bitos de la Fundaci&oacute;n Sistema Estatal 
  de An&aacute;lisis de Datos y de la Secretaria de Estado de la Salud de Sao 
  Paulo. Se analiz&oacute; la completitud de las variables de las declaraciones 
  de &oacute;bito fetal emitidas por hospitales y Servicio de Verificaci&oacute;n 
  de &Oacute;bitos. Los registros de las declaraciones de &oacute;bito de una 
  muestra de 212 &oacute;bitos fetales de hospitales del Sistema &Uacute;nico 
  de Salud (p&uacute;blico) fueron comparados con los dados de los prontuarios 
  y del registro del Servicio de Verificaci&oacute;n de &Oacute;bitos.<br>
  <b>RESULTADOS: </b> Entre as declaraciones de &oacute;bito, 75% fueron emitidas 
  por el Servicio de Verificaci&oacute;n de &Oacute;bitos, m&aacute;s frecuente 
  en los hospitales p&uacute;blicos (78%). La completitud de las variables de 
  las declaraciones de &oacute;bito emitidas por los hospitales fue m&aacute;s 
  elevada y fue mayor en los hospitales no-p&uacute;blicos. Hubo mayor completitud, 
  concordancia y sensibilidad en las declaraciones de &oacute;bito emitidas por 
  los hospitales. Hubo baja concordancia y elevada especificidad para las variables 
  relativas a las caracter&iacute;sticas maternas. Mayor registro de las variables 
  sexo, peso al nacer y duraci&oacute;n de la gestaci&oacute;n fue observada en 
  las declaraciones emitidas en el Servicio de Verificaci&oacute;n de &Oacute;bito. 
  La autopsia no result&oacute; en mejoramiento de la indicaci&oacute;n de las 
  causas de muerte: la muerte fetal no especificada represent&oacute; 65,7% y 
  la hipoxia intrauterina, 24,3%, mientras que en las declaraciones emitidas por 
  los hospitales fue de 18,1% y 41,7%, respectivamente.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONES: </b> Es necesario mejorar la completitud y la indicaci&oacute;n 
  de las causas de muerte de los &oacute;bitos fetales. La elevada proporci&oacute;n 
  de autopsias no mejor&oacute; la calidad de la informaci&oacute;n y la indicaci&oacute;n 
  de las causas de muerte. La calidad de las informaciones generadas de autopsias

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although fetal 
  deaths account for the majority of perinatal deaths, they are not well understood 
  and studied,<sup>7,8,16,17</sup> and remain almost invisible throughout the 
  world. Systematic and reliable records of these events are essential to understand 
  the problem. Nonetheless, quantification of fetal deaths remains insufficient; 
  detailed information is necessary to support interventions to prevent fetal 
  mortality.<sup>8</sup> Information from mortality information systems are an 
  important tool to identify potential risk factors. Based on mortality data, 
  studies have identified the role of twins,<sup>8</sup> maternal age<sup>5,13,17</sup> 
  and gestational age<sup>5,13</sup> on fetal mortality.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Euro Perinatal 
  Statistics project of the European Union defined specific indicators for monitoring 
  perinatal mortality, like birth weight, gestational age, time of death (antenatal/intrapartum), 
  maternal age and parity.<sup>25</sup> The indicators are obtained from vital 
  statistics databases.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Causes of death 
  are also important for understanding and preventing fetal deaths. Performance 
  of autopsies can improve data quality. Some countries such as the United Kingdom 
  propose that 100% of fetal deaths should be autopsied, although a study in Whales 
  found an autopsy rate of 60.5% for fetal deaths between 1994 and 2003.<sup>1</sup> 
  Comparison of vital statistics with hospital records is a method to evaluate 
  information quality and should be used in quality improvement.<sup>10,12,20,21</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There have been 
  few studies about fetal mortality in Brazil,<sup>3,7,18,22</sup> and this indicator 
  is not included among the basic Brazilian health indicators. Eight Brazilian 
  federative units have perinatal mortality data considered as good quality. Under-notification 
  of fetal deaths and low completeness of information on death certificates contribute 
  to this problem.<sup>2,4</sup> Nonetheless, perinatal and fetal mortality merits 
  increased attention in national health research, given their growing importance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In S&atilde;o Paulo, 
  S&atilde;o Paulo state, 99.4% of deliveries occur in hospital wards, mainly 
  in high complexity hospitals.<sup>23</sup> Fetal mortality was 7.2 per one thousand 
  births and accounted for 56% of perinatal deaths in 2008. It has been the principal 
  component of perinatal mortality since 1996.<a href="#backa">ª</a> Fetal deaths 
  were 14.6 times more frequent than maternal deaths and constituted 60% of infant 
  deaths in 2008.<a href="#backa">ª</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Vital statistics 
  in S&atilde;o Paulo have good coverage of events. Data from 2006<a name="topa"></a><a href="#backa">ª</a> 
  show that the majority of fetal death certificates (70%) were autopsied, a similar 
  proportion as in developed countries, which may suggest good quality information.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study objective 
  was to evaluate the quality of information from fetal death certificates in 
  S&atilde;o Paulo municipality, in southeast Brazil.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Methods</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study analyzed 
  710 fetal deaths among resident mothers delivering in hospitals of S&atilde;o 
  Paulo municipality, during the first semester of 2008. Data were obtained from 
  the unified database of deaths from the <i>Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o Sistema Estadual 
  de An&aacute;lise de Dados</i> (SEADE, State System Foundation of Data Analysis) 
  and the S&atilde;o Paulo State Health Secretary. Deaths that occurred at home 
  were excluded. Deaths from deliveries in hospitals with less than 100/births 
  per year were also excluded due to infrequent fulfilling of fetal death certificates.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Identification 
  of the institution responsible for fulfilling of the death certificate was performed 
  using field 52 of the death certificate (Did signing physician attended the 
  death? 1- Yes; 2-Substitute; 3-Medical Legal Institute; 4-Coroner's Office &#91;CO&#93; 
  and 5-Others). Responses 1, 2 and 5 were considered as death certificates by 
  hospitals. Events identified as Medical Legal Institute and with those not filled 
  in were excluded.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The hospital where 
  death occurred was identified on the death certificate and subsequently classified 
  as part of the <i>Sistema &Uacute;nico de Sa&uacute;de</i> (SUS, National Unified 
  Health System) or non-SUS, according to information from the <i>Cadastro Nacional 
  de Estabelecimentos de Sa&uacute;de</i> (CNES, National Registration of Health 
  Establishments). Death certificates without hospital name and code were excluded.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Completeness of 
  data on certificates was classified as excellent (above 95%); good (from 90% 
  to 95%); moderate (from 70% to 90%); poor (from 50% to 70%); and very poor (less 
  than 50%).<sup>6</sup> The variables analyzed were maternal characteristics 
  (age; education; number of previous children alive and deceased); pregnancy/delivery 
  (gestational age, type of pregnancy and delivery mode) and fetal (sex and birth 
  weight).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a second step 
  of the study, fetal deaths from a sample of SUS hospitals in S&atilde;o Paulo 
  municipality were analyzed. The 11 SUS hospitals studied (ten high complexity 
  and one medium complexity)<sup>23</sup> are representative of the SUS network. 
  Fetal deaths occurring in four municipal owned hospitals, two state hospitals, 
  three university hospitals (two public and one philanthropic) and two from the 
  Social Organizations of Health were studied. Education (medical residency) take 
  place in the university hospitals and in three other public institutions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Data completeness 
  (percentage filled in) and the primary cause of death on death certificates 
  fulfilled by hospitals and CO were compared. Causes of death were classified 
  based on the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related 
  Health Problems (ICD-10). The cause of death coding was performed by SEADE Foundation. 
  A specific protocol was used to extract information from the obstetric medical 
  records at hospitals. A specific protocol was applied to obtain data from the 
  records of the CO.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Agreement was calculated 
  for each variable based on data registered in hospital records and death certificates. 
  Sensitivity and specificity were estimated for the information recorded, with 
  the gold standard being hospital records.<sup>15</sup> Sensitivity was defined 
  as the proportion of information present in medical records and death certificates 
  in relation to the total hospital records with information. Specificity was 
  defined as the proportion of information missing in the two data sources, among 
  events that were not included in hospital records.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The project was 
  approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Faculdade de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica 
  da Universidade de S&atilde;o Paulo (Process n&#186; 049/07) on 20 of April 
  of 2007.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Results</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the 710 deaths, 
  75.1% of death certificates were issued by the CO and 24.9% by hospitals that 
  provided delivery care (<a href="#t1">Table 1</a>). Death certificates were 
  issued by the CO 19% more frequently for deaths in SUS hospitals compared to 
  non-SUS hospitals (p &lt; 0.001; 95%CI 1.06;1.34).</font></p>
<p><a name="t1"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2750t01.jpg"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Completeness for 
  fetal sex and birth weight was excellent for fetal death certificates issued 
  by CO and were respectively excellent and good in death certificates emitted 
  by hospitals. The variables related to maternal characteristics (age, education 
  and previous children) had poor completeness, and hospitals performed better 
  than the CO, especially non-SUS hospitals which had completeness between moderate 
  and good. Completeness was good and excellent for variables related to pregnancy 
  and delivery in non-SUS hospitals and moderate in the SUS network. Death certificates 
  issued by CO showed large variability in data completeness: good (gestational 
  age and birth weight), moderate (type of pregnancy) and very poor (delivery 
  mode). Death certificates from hospitals, especially non-SUS hospitals, presented 
  greater completeness than those filled in by the CO (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2750t02.jpg">Table 
  2</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fetal deaths in 
  the 11 SUS hospitals represented 39% of the total deaths in SUS hospitals during 
  the study period. Of the sample, 66% of death certificates were emitted by CO 
  and 34% by hospitals (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2750t03.jpg">Table 3</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For referral of 
  fetal deaths to CO, a police report must be made, authorizing removal of the 
  corpse from the hospital. In 88.6% of deaths, the police report was solicited 
  by family members, and in the remaining cases, by other people, including hospital 
  staff made the request. The Municipal Health Secretary introduced Cadaver Referral 
  Guidelines, in order to improve hospital information sent to the CO; nonetheless, 
  the guidelines were present in only 21.4% of records at the CO.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The analysis according 
  to source of death certificate (hospital or CO) did not show significant differences 
  in completeness of records. Differences were observed when comparing the proportion 
  of variables recorded on medical records and death certificates, although there 
  was no consistent trend. Maternal characteristics had lower completeness in 
  death certificates issued by CO compared to hospital records. Recording of maternal 
  education was minimal (3.6%). Gestational age was complete in 97.8% of death 
  certificates and 66.4% of medical records, and type of pregnancy was complete 
  in 80.4% and 86.4%, respectively. Type of delivery was practically not registered 
  on death certificates (1.4%), although it was present in 98.6% of hospital records. 
  In regards to the fetal characteristics, completeness was high in medical records 
  and death certificates, especially in the later (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2750t03.jpg">Table 
  3</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among death certificates 
  issued by hospitals, all variables with the exception of maternal age present 
  greater completeness in death certificates than medical records, even though 
  completeness is unsatisfactory in both sources. The variables related to gestation/birth, 
  type of pregnancy and type of delivery presented higher completeness in medical 
  records. Sex and birth weight had excellent completeness and were slightly better 
  in death certificates (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2750t03.jpg">Table 3</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The agreement between 
  medical records and death certificates issued by the CO was obtained. Data from 
  medical records were considered the gold standard, since they are a primary 
  information source and easily recovered (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2750t03.jpg">Table 
  3</a>). In death certificates emitted by CO, there was high agreement for the 
  variables birth weight and sex and low agreement for the other variables. Birth 
  weight and sex presented high sensitivity, and the other variables had low sensitivity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In death certificated 
  fulfilled by hospitals, there was good agreement between the variables sex, 
  birth weight, type of pregnancy and maternal age. High sensitivity (above 80%) 
  was found for birth weight, sex and type of pregnancy, indicating good recording 
  of these variables in the two data sources. Nonetheless, the high agreement 
  for maternal age was due to the absence of information in the two sources.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fetal deaths sent 
  to the CO were predominantly pre-term (96.4%), with high concentration during 
  the period of 32 to 36 weeks (35.7%). There were differences in the cause of 
  death between the hospital death certificates and those from CO (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2750t04.jpg">Table 
  4</a>). Unspecified fetal death was the principal cause of death on death certificates 
  issues by CO, and more frequent than those fulfilled by hospitals (OR=8.6, 95%CI 
  4.37;17.78; p &lt;0.001); intrauterine hypoxia was more common on hospital death 
  certificates (OR=0.45; 95%CI 0.24;0.83; p&lt;0.001) and the main cause of death 
  for this group. These two causes of deaths were responsible for almost 80% of 
  total deaths.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among death certificates 
  emitted by hospitals there was more diversity of primary cause of death, and 
  placenta and umbilical cord complications were present, but these causes were 
  absent in the group sent to the CO. Congenital malformations did not present 
  a statistically significant difference (OR=0.50; 95%CI 0.11;2.29; p=0.179) between 
  death certificates emitted by CO and hospitals, nor did other perinatal causes 
  (OR=0.77; 95%CI: 0.11-6.58; p=0.770).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Discussion</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Completeness of 
  fetal death certificates in S&atilde;o Paulo municipality was good or excellent 
  when considering gestational age, sex and birth weight. Type of pregnancy had 
  moderate completeness, and the other variables presented very poor completeness, 
  Therefore, specific mortality indicators cannot be calculated according to maternal 
  characteristics, such as age, education and parity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SUS and non-SUS 
  hospitals presented differences in completeness for variables based on information 
  routinely collected in hospital care, demonstrating greater care in the transcription 
  of data from hospital records to death certificates.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Performance of 
  fetal autopsies is supposed to produce more detailed and higher quality information. 
  Two-thirds of fetal deaths were referred to the CO for autopsy, a level that 
  approximated developed countries.<sup>1,14</sup> Nonetheless, recording of data 
  on death certificates from CO was less consistent than in hospitals.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In death certificates 
  from CO, the variables obtained either directly or indirectly by autopsy (sex, 
  birth weight and gestational age) presented similar, and sometimes higher, completeness 
  than death certificates emitted by hospitals. CO do not have access to hospital 
  records and instead only have access to data registered on the police reports 
  emitted by the police precinct. The use of the Cadaver Referral Guide<a name="topb"></a><a href="#backb"><sup>b</sup></a> 
  was unable to resolve the problem, since it was present in CO records for 21.4% 
  of reviewed deaths (SUS hospitals), which explains the low completeness of variables 
  that depend on information unobtainable by fetal autopsy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">High completeness 
  for birth weight was observed for death certificates emitted by CO, although 
  the measurement was performed at autopsy and did not represent true birth weight. 
  Gestational age, which had good completeness overall, is provided by family 
  members and is written in months in CO records. The calculation for weeks is 
  performed when death certificates are filled out, which can involve measurement 
  errors in data transcription.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The high proportion 
  of fetal death certificates emitted by CO can be related to the combination 
  of four factors: a) performance of fetal autopsies is thought to improve the 
  identification of cause of death by obstetricians; b) the high proportion of 
  antepartum fetal deaths (approximately 90%)<sup>3</sup> combined with the lack 
  of integration between prenatal care and delivery, results in the woman's health 
  records not being sent to the delivery hospital; c) the relative proximity of 
  CO in the capital; d) the reluctance of health professionals to report unfavorable 
  outcomes.<sup>8</sup> These factors can incentivize obstetricians to judge antepartum 
  fetal deaths as undefined deaths and to refer them to autopsy. The situation 
  was more frequent in SUS hospitals, probably due to the need of family authorization.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recording of data 
  in hospital records was more complete than information in death certificates, 
  except for the variables birth weight, sex and gestational age. For almost all 
  the other variables there was a loss of data during transcription from medical 
  records to death certificates, especially those emitted by the CO. This results 
  in a low degree of agreement for the majority of variables.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The type of pregnancy 
  had lower agreement for death certificates emitted by SUS hospitals and CO, 
  when compared to a study in Washington in the USA.<sup>15</sup> The variable 
  for previous live births had even lower agreement than in the Washington study.<sup>15</sup> 
  These results suggest a lower preoccupation in the recording of information 
  on death certificates emitted in S&atilde;o Paulo. The study in the United States 
  compared the values recorded in death certificates and medical records, and 
  in the current study, agreement refers to the presence of information and not 
  their values in death certificates and medical records.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The presence of 
  birth weight and gestational age had a high sensitivity in the death certificates 
  emitted by hospitals, indicating simultaneous recording of both documents. With 
  the exception of age, there was low recording of maternal characteristics in 
  medical records and therefore low completeness of death certificates.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although the objective 
  of performing autopsies is to improve information on cause of death, the majority 
  of death certificates emitted by CO attributed the primary cause of death as 
  unspecified. The most frequent cause of death indicated by CO was unspecified 
  fetal death, followed by intra-uterine hypoxia. These positions were reversed 
  in death certificates emitted by hospitals. A similar result was obtained in 
  Massachusetts in the USA,<sup>13</sup> where a comparison of the cause of death 
  on death certificates with autopsy results demonstrated that a portion of deaths 
  indicated as asphyxia on death certificates, were subsequently considered as 
  unknown following autopsy. Perinatal autopsies performed in a referral hospital 
  in Curitiba<sup>19</sup> found 15.7% of fetal deaths as unspecified.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The variety in 
  the classification of fetal deaths<sup>9</sup> makes the comparison of results 
  complex. The proportion of deaths due to unknown or unexplained causes depends 
  on the classification used by various studies. A study performed in West Midlands<sup>9</sup> 
  in England found 66% of deaths were considered as unexplained fetal deaths using 
  the Wigglesworth classification,<sup>24</sup> and when employing the Classification 
  System according to the Relevant Mortality Code,<sup>9</sup> 15.1% were classified 
  as unknown. A study involving the classification system adopted by Australia 
  and New Zealand found that the cause of death reported by hospitals was undetermined 
  in 26.7% of antepartum fetal deaths, although this proportion increased to 38.4% 
  when reviewed by the Perinatal Mortality Committee.<sup>11</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In death certificates 
  emitted by hospitals, besides the aforementioned causes of death, there was 
  a high proportion of deaths due to gestational complications, as well as placenta 
  and umbilical cord complications, which were absent from death certificates 
  emitted by CO. This finding may be due to the absence of clinical information 
  concerning the pregnancy and delivery, during autopsy. In addition, the placentas 
  do not accompany the fetuses for autopsy which complicates the identification 
  of cause of death.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some authors indicate 
  that there are problems in the use of ICD-10 for the study of fetal deaths,<sup>8</sup> 
  specifying that the codes referring to placental conditions are incomplete and 
  include few pathologies. There is also overlap between obstetric and perinatal 
  conditions which could contribute to the high proportion of undefined or unexplained 
  deaths, demonstrating the need to introduce modifications in the next ICD revision.<sup>8</sup> 
  Information about fetal deaths can be improved with the introduction of a specific 
  fetal death certificate, which could include more detailed information about 
  gestational complications.<sup>14</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 2005, fetal 
  deaths of 2,500 or more grams were included in investigations that should be 
  performed by the Infant and Fetal Death Surveillance Committees<a name="topc"></a><a href="#backc"><sup>c</sup></a> 
  to improve information and obtain a better understanding for prevention programs. 
  It is possible that compulsory surveillance of infant and fetal deaths by the 
  SUS health services (public and private) <a name="topd"></a><a href="#backd"><sup>d</sup></a> 
  will improve information quality.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The removal of 
  the fetuses form the hospital to the CO occurs after a police report is submitted 
  by the police station responsible for the area where the hospital is located. 
  In the sample of SUS hospitals, the police reports for almost 90% of deaths 
  referred to CO were requested by family members. Instead of family members receiving 
  counseling and support from health services, they are referred to police stations 
  to obtain the document. Families in S&atilde;o Paulo state that use SUS and 
  experience a fetal loss, appear to receive a different level of care than offered 
  in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Australia, where support and 
  counseling activities are provided to families.<a name="tope"></a><a href="#backe"><sup>e</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In conclusion, 
  it is necessary to improve completeness and reporting for the cause of death 
  in fetal deaths. The high proportion of autopsies did not improve information 
  quality. Improvement of information quality on CO death certificates depends 
  on access to hospital information. Good quality vital statistics are a critical 
  first step for the research, monitoring and prevention of fetal mortality. Sensitization 
  of managers and health professionals is fundamental to improve the information 
  available about fetal deaths. It is possible to develop routines to facilitate 
  the adequate flow of information between prenatal care services and hospitals 
  and subsequently to CO. In addition, it is necessary to improve support for 
  families that experience a fetal death.</font></p>
