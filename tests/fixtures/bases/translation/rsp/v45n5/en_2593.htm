<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Birth weight is 
  an important parameter related to perinatal and child morbidity and mortality.<sup>18</sup> 
  Low birth weight is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as weight 
  at birth of less than 2,500 grams,<sup>20</sup> and this is one of the factors 
  that determine neonatal mortality, higher risk of infections, greater propensity 
  to growth delay and postnatal neuropsychological deficit. In addition, it may 
  influence the health conditions of the adult.<sup>8</sup> The rates undergo 
  great variations in diverse regions of the world, with evident disadvantages 
  to the less developed countries, because they are associated with unfavorable 
  socioeconomic conditions.<sup>3,9</sup> A Brazilian study has shown a 10% incidence 
  of low birth weight.<sup>2</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Low birth weight 
  is strongly related to harmful maternal habits, mainly the consumption of alcoholic 
  beverages.<sup>15</sup> The literature shows higher risk of malformations, spontaneous 
  miscarriage, low birth weight, prematurity, asphyxia and perinatal mortality, 
  besides several physical and mental problems deriving from the Fetal Alcohol 
  Syndrome.<sup>18</sup> During the gestational period, the prevalence of inadequate 
  alcohol use varies from 2.0% to 40.6%.<sup>1,2,18</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The alcohol that 
  the mother ingests during gestation crosses the placental barrier and the fetus 
  is exposed to this substance that is present in the maternal blood. Fetal exposure 
  is greater due to its slow metabolism and elimination system; thus the amniotic 
  fluid remains impregnated with unmodified alcohol (ethanol) and acetaldehyde 
  (a metabolite of ethanol).<sup>7</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ethanol induces 
  the formation of oxygen free radicals that are capable of damaging cellular 
  proteins and lipids, which increases apoptosis or "programmed cellular death" 
  and negatively affects cellular divisions and specifications. Ethanol also inhibits 
  the synthesis of retinoic acid, a substance that regulates embryonic development.<sup>7</sup> 
  The consumption of 20 grams of alcohol seems to be enough to suppress fetal 
  breathing and movements.<sup>4</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Alcohol consumption 
  may be underdiagnosed during gestation, probably due to the health professionals' 
  unpreparedness to investigate adequately or to give importance to complaints 
  compatible with the habit of drinking.<sup>15</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to 
  alcohol abuse during pregnancy, other factors may be associated with low weight, 
  like low maternal age, not receiving prenatal care, female newborn, prematurity, 
  low socioeconomic condition and smoking during pregnancy.<sup>17,19</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, the present 
  study aimed to analyze the association between alcohol abuse during gestation 
  and low birth weight.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study is nested 
  to a cohort that monitored families since the prenatal period until 12 months 
  in the postpartum period, with the objective of evaluating psychiatric disorders 
  in mothers and fathers and child developmental delay. The sample was constituted 
  by 1,062 women who received prenatal care through the <i>Sistema &Uacute;nico 
  de Sa&uacute;de</i> (Brazil's National Health System) of the city of Pelotas, 
  Southern Brazil, and delivered their babies between September 2007 and September 
  2008. The women were captured by means of the <i>Sistema de Acompanhamento do 
  Programa de Humaniza&ccedil;&atilde;o no Pr&eacute;-Natal e Nascimento</i> (System 
  to Accompany the Prenatal and Birth Humanization Program, SISPRENATAL) of the 
  Municipal Department of Health. The SISPRENATAL is a government program that 
  stimulates primary care units to provide prenatal assistance. It provides funds 
  for the unit every time a pregnant woman is enrolled. Data such as address, 
  phone number and gestational age (calculated based on the date of the last menstruation) 
  were obtained from the program's medical record. The only exclusion criterion 
  was to reside in the rural zone of the city of Pelotas (n = 44).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The women were 
  interviewed at their homes between 30 and 45 days after delivery by means of 
  a questionnaire about economic conditions, maternal characteristics, prenatal 
  care and smoking during pregnancy. Alcohol abuse was verified by means of the 
  CAGE scale (Cut down, Annoyed by criticism, Guilty and Eye-opener), validated 
  to Brazil by Castells &amp; Furlanetto.<sup>5</sup> This scale considers that 
  two or more affirmative answers are indicative of alcohol abuse.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The child's weight 
  and sex data, as well as gestational age at delivery, by means of which prematurity 
  was verified, were obtained from the baby's health card.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The newborns up 
  to 2,499 grams were considered low weight. The families' socioeconomic level 
  was classified into five levels (A, B, C, D and E), according to <i>Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o 
  Brasileira de Empresas de Pesquisa</i> (ABEP - Brazilian Survey Companies Association),<a name="topa"></a><a href="#backa">ª</a> 
  which is based on the accumulation of material goods and on the level of schooling 
  of the head of household. In the present study, the levels were merged into 
  three (A and B; C; D and E). Maternal age was divided into three categories: 
  up to 19 years, 20 to 34 and 35 or older.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After the collection, 
  the data were double-entered in the program EpiInfo 6.04 for comparison and 
  elimination of inconsistencies. The statistical package SPSS 10.0 for Windows 
  was used for data analysis. Univariate analysis by simple frequency was conducted 
  to learn about the sample's characteristics, and bivariate analysis (chi-square 
  test), for comparison between proportions. To control for possible confounding 
  factors, logistic regression was used, based on the following hierarchical model: 
  in the first level, socioeconomic classification and maternal age; in the second 
  level, prenatal care, smoking during gestation, newborn's sex, prematurity, 
  and alcohol abuse; and as the outcome, low birth weight.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To verify the power 
  of association, a significance level of 95% was used, as well as power of association 
  of 80%. The initial sample was constituted by 1,062 women. There was 11% (105) 
  of losses or refusals in the second part of the study and the final sample was 
  constituted by 957 mothers. With a sample of 957 women, it was possible to establish 
  a power of association of 99%.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The investigation 
  was approved by the research ethics committee of Universidade Cat&oacute;lica 
  de Pelotas according to the norms that were in force at the time (CONEP-Res196/96), 
  under the protocol no. 2007/95.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the 957 participant 
  mothers, 99 (11.5%) belonged to classes A and B, 471 (54.5%) to class C and 
  294 (30.0%) to classes D and E. The majority of the mothers (69.7%) were between 
  20 and 34 years of age. Among the interviewees, 821 (88.9%) received prenatal 
  assistance, and 254 (33.8%) were smokers. Among the newborns, 486 (54.2%) were 
  males, 95 (10.0%) were born at low birth weight and 238 (24.9%) were born premature 
  (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2593t01.jpg">Table</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Alcohol abuse was 
  verified in 19 (2.1%) women. There was association between prematurity and low 
  weight (p&lt;0.001) and alcohol abuse and low birth weight (p&lt;0.038), and 
  26.3% of the mothers who reported alcohol abuse in gestation delivered low birth 
  weight babies. The variables that presented association with birth weight in 
  the bivariate analyses with level of significance &lt;0.20 were included in 
  the regression models.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the multiple 
  regression analysis, after adjustments for prematurity and alcohol abuse, low 
  birth weight remained associated with prematurity (p&lt;0.001) and alcohol abuse 
  in gestation (p&lt;0.020). The preterm babies were 11 times more likely to be 
  born at low weight than those who were born at term, even controlling for alcohol 
  abuse (p&lt;0.020). The likelihood of a baby being born at low weight was four 
  times higher among those whose mothers abused alcohol during gestation (OR= 
  4.20; 95%CI: 1.25;14.13).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present study 
  revealed a 10% incidence of low birth weight, a value that is similar to the 
  one found in Brazilian studies.<sup>2,8</sup> The prevalence of alcohol abuse 
  was of 2.1%; however, other studies have shown variation in alcohol consumption 
  during pregnancy from 2.0% to 40.6%, depending on the utilized investigation 
  method.<sup>1,2,18</sup> Moraes &amp; Reichenheim<sup>18</sup> found a 7.3% 
  prevalence of alcohol abuse in gestation. The low percentage of alcohol abuse 
  in the present study may derive from the utilization of the CAGE instrument. 
  Moraes &amp; Reichenheim<sup>18</sup> argue that the cutoff point of this instrument 
  (two affirmative answers) is high when employed in pregnant women, because it 
  suggests a positive screening only for alcohol abuse or dependence.<sup>18</sup> 
  Thus, the CAGE instrument does not take into account lower alcohol ingestions; 
  it only considers them as suspicion of alcohol problems. In gestation, such 
  situation would be of great importance, since safe levels of alcohol consumption 
  in this period are not known. Another important factor that may justify the 
  low prevalence of alcohol abuse during gestation is the question of social acceptability. 
  Pregnant women are usually aware that alcohol consumption is harmful to the 
  fetus, and tend to omit the use of alcoholic beverages due to fear of being 
  disapproved both by society and by the health services.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nevertheless, even 
  with the low prevalence that was found, the association between alcohol abuse 
  and low birth weight after the adjustment should not be minimized. The literature 
  shows variation from 32.0% to 48.1% in the incidence of low birth weight in 
  children born to mothers who ingested alcohol during gestation.<sup>12,16</sup> 
  In the present study, 26.3% of the mothers who abused alcohol delivered low 
  weight babies.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The statistical 
  analysis identified that preterm children are more likely to be born weighing 
  less than 2,500g. Birth weight is strongly associated with prematurity. Children 
  born before 37 weeks were almost 35 times more likely to weigh less than 2,500g 
  than those whose gestational age was higher.<sup>3</sup> The results found by 
  Carniel et al<sup>3</sup> are similar to the others from the literature that 
  were mentioned above, with a 28.7% incidence among low weight infants who were 
  born premature. The mechanisms through which alcohol affects intrauterine growth 
  are not well known; therefore, we decided to maintain the adjustment for prematurity 
  in the hierarchical model. Although the causal chain alcohol-prematurity-low 
  weight is known, the present study confirmed that the association between alcohol 
  and low weight occurs even in the absence of prematurity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Zambonato et al<sup>21</sup> 
  have shown greater association between smoking in gestation and intrauterine 
  growth restriction than with low weight. In the present study, smoking during 
  gestation did not associate significantly with low birth weight, perhaps because 
  it was underdiagnosed, like alcohol abuse, due to social acceptability. The 
  pregnant women, fearing a possible recrimination and disapproval on the part 
  of health professionals, may expose less consumption of these substances or 
  even deny it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Giglio et al<sup>9</sup> 
  have described association between maternal age and low birth weight, with higher 
  occurrence of low weight among children born to mothers who are in the extremes 
  of reproductive life, that is, younger than 19 years or older than 35 years. 
  This association was not found in the present study, but 69.7% of the pregnant 
  women who were interviewed were between 20 and 34 years old. Kassar et al<sup>13</sup> 
  studied adolescent and adult mothers younger than 35 years and showed that maternal 
  age did not influence the variation in birth weight. Thus, the influence of 
  maternal age on low birth weight is contradictory, because the mother's chronological 
  age, by itself, is not a good predictor of birth weight. The complexity of the 
  evaluation derives from the consideration of the biological expression of an 
  event that does not occur in isolation from other dimensions. It is fundamental 
  to consider the interaction of many dimensions, such as the socioeconomic, psychological 
  and cultural, over the considered and/or studied biological responses.<sup>13</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A study has shown 
  that poorer children have a 2.4 times higher risk of being born at low weight 
  than those of richer families.<sup>10</sup> In the present study there was no 
  association between socioeconomic class and low birth weight; however, it must 
  be considered that the sample was constituted by 54.5% of women from class C, 
  which is considered intermediate.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Prenatal care was 
  not related to low birth weight. This relation has been questioned by studies 
  such as the one by Hueston et al,<sup>11</sup> which did not find lower rates 
  of low weight babies among North-American women who received early prenatal 
  assistance. However, in the present study 88.9% of the women received prenatal 
  assistance, whereas the others, although they denied having received prenatal 
  assistance, attended at least one consultation of this type, as the sample was 
  extracted from a prenatal enrolment program.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A possible limitation 
  of the present study is related to the non-utilization of an instrument considered 
  to be the gold standard to identify the many stages of alcohol use during gestation. 
  The CAGE explores specifically the social effects of the inadequate use of alcohol, 
  based on the patient's perception of his/her own habits, and on the perception 
  of his/her relatives and friends, which might cause misunderstandings in the 
  interpretation of the findings.<sup>18</sup> Yet, the CAGE is adequate to track 
  alcohol abuse, to the detriment of the clinical interview, which is difficult 
  to perform when we are dealing with primary care. Even with the non-ideal characteristics 
  of the instrument, the finding of the present study should be valued. The reason 
  is that the cutoff point of the above-mentioned instrument has high specificity, 
  which makes the 2.1% of women who abused alcohol during pregnancy be relevant 
  in view of the association with low birth weight.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To reduce the consumption 
  of alcoholic beverages during gestation, multidisciplinary work is necessary. 
  When alcohol use is diagnosed, the patient should promptly receive intensive 
  treatment, with psychological support and approaches that motivate her to change. 
  Educational actions since the beginning of pregnancy and home visits increase 
  adherence to the treatment and the chances of reduction or abandonment of alcohol 
  ingestion during gestation.<a name="topb"></a><a href="#backb"><sup>b</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The mechanisms 
  through which alcohol affects the conceptus have not been fully clarified yet. 
  It is believed that the fetus is exposed to alcohol concentrations that are 
  similar to those of the maternal blood, which makes the environment inadequate 
  to the fetus and favors the incidence of the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. This is 
  characterized by damage to the central nervous system, which causes neurological 
  and craniofacial anomalies, deficit in pre- and post-natal growth, behavioral 
  disorders and emotional difficulties.<sup>6,7</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The data showed 
  in the present study are a warning so that health professionals track the abusive 
  use of alcohol by pregnant women, since there is an indication that alcohol 
  consumption in gestation is related to factors that may affect delivery, like 
  premature placental abruption, uterine hypertonia, premature labor and meconium-stained 
  amniotic fluid.<sup>7</sup></font></p>
