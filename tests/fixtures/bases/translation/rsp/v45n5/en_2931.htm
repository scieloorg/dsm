<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> 
  To describe a participatory educational program for building up knowledge on 
  malaria among primary school teachers in a highly endemic city.<br>
  <b>METHODS: </b> An observational study was conducted. A 40-hour course with 
  a multidisciplinary and problematizing approach was held in 2008, including 
  46 teachers mainly from rural areas of the city of Barcelos, Northern Brazil. 
  The participatory educational process was comprised of workshops and practical 
  classes. A previously validated questionnaire was applied before and after the 
  course to assess teachers' knowledge and subsequently analyzed using qualitative 
  and quantitative approaches and open-response thematic analysis.<br>
  <b>RESULTS: </b> Prior to the course, teachers had little information about 
  the transmission mechanisms, means of prevention, and the association between 
  malaria and its vectors, and their health concepts were limited. After the course, 
  teachers' knowledge of malaria increased and they reflected on their role in 
  society.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS: </b> The effect of the educational program on the construction 
  of contextualized knowledge of malaria and health indicates the potential of 
  the strategy developed. Continuing education processes are required for the 
  maintenance of new knowledge and practices directed towards health promotion.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the efforts 
  made to control malaria, this disease continues to be highly endemic in several 
  areas of the legal Amazon region.<sup>18</sup> The majority of studies refer 
  to basic biological aspects of the parasite and its vector, and others to clinical, 
  epidemiological and therapeutic efficacy studies. Since the 1990s, there has 
  been an emphasis on the importance of studies on sociocultural aspects that 
  enable greater awareness of the communities' behavior towards this disease, 
  so that new control strategies with a community approach can be planned.<sup>7,8,12</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the elimination 
  of malaria is associated with changes in risk behaviors, health education is 
  a key instrument.<sup>10</sup> The inclusion of educational practices in the 
  routine of students living in malaria-endemic cities is a way to raise knowledge 
  that promotes prevention practices and attitudes in the communities.<sup>20,</sup><a href="#backa">ª</a><sup>,</sup><a href="#backb"><sup>b</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present study 
  aimed to describe a participatory educational strategy on knowledge of malaria 
  among primary school teachers.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The municipaliy 
  of Barcelos is located in the state of Amazonas, in northern Brazil, and it 
  is this country's second largest municipality in area. It has 24,567 inhabitants, 
  55.6% of whom live in rural areas. The municipal seat is situated on the right 
  bank of the Negro River, which is 390 km away from the capital of Amazonas in 
  a straight line and 496 km away by river. It is a highly malaria-endemic area 
  with an annual mean of 5,033 cases in the last five years and a mean annual 
  parasite incidence of 156.4 cases per 1,000 inhabitants.<sup>22</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The educational 
  action developed was based on Paulo Freire's ideas, seeking to "problematize" 
  reality.<sup>9</sup> Actions included group dynamics as a psychosocial intervention 
  resource, according to recommendations by Afonso.<sup>1</sup> The results obtained 
  with the health education process included a project for the development and 
  assessment of an integrated strategy for endemic disease control in this area.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The course had 
  a multidisciplinary and problematizing emphasis and lasted 40 hours. A total 
  of 46 primary and secondary school teachers of the municipal and state school 
  network participated in this course. Simple language and a variety of images 
  were used, including biomedical and social aspects involved in disease transmission 
  and maintenance. The process included workshops and practical classes, where 
  teachers were instructed about the educational possibilities to include this 
  theme in the school curriculum, with approaches that are adequate for students' 
  different age groups and contextualized in the local reality. Basic aspects 
  of malaria were approached, such as the biology of the parasite and its vectors; 
  identification using magnifying glasses and microscopes; clinical, diagnostic 
  and therapeutic aspects; risk factors; and transmission dynamics. In addition, 
  the following aspects were also approached: methods for the planning of educational 
  and control actions and the role of the <i>Sistema &Uacute;nico de Sa&uacute;de</i> 
  (SUS - Brazilian Unified Health System), the importance of information in schools 
  and communities, health and environmental measures, practices to develop activities 
  with students and the population in the communities, and the preparation of 
  local educational materials and of integrated project models for each participant, 
  which fit the location itself. A (pre-course) questionnaire was applied on the 
  first school day and another (post-course) questionnaire was applied on the 
  last school day, each comprised of 27 open and closed questions. Questionnaires 
  included questions about general health and specific questions about malaria, 
  considering basic disease aspects (clinical symptoms, risk of death, treatment), 
  previous contact with the disease and knowledge of transmission. This instrument 
  enabled the assessment of teachers' previous knowledge of malaria, knowledge 
  of malaria acquired during the course and mastery of the educational practices 
  to work with this theme in the classroom after the educational process. The 
  questionnaires, developed from the assumptions described by G&uuml;nther,<sup>11</sup> 
  were previously validated with a group of local teachers, who had the same profile. 
  These questionnaires were characterized by their simple language, adapted to 
  the local reality and including words used colloquially in the area.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the statistical 
  analysis, data were stored using EpiInfo software, version 6.0. Student's t-test 
  was used to compare the measures of continuous variables between two series 
  of data with GraphPad Prism, version 4.0 for Windows. </font><font size="2">&#935;</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#178; 
  statistical test was used for the association tests. Yates correction was applied 
  when the expected values were lower than five. In all analyses, a 5% significance 
  level was adopted. Open responses were analyzed with a qualitative approach.<sup>4</sup> 
  Teachers' responses to open questions were categorized into units (words or 
  sentences) that repeated themselves, seeking to interpret the meanings included 
  in the materials collected to obtain the true meaning.<sup>5,6,20</sup> Thematic 
  analysis was used in this study. This is one of the content analysis categories, 
  comprised of the following stages: pre-analysis, material exploration and treatment 
  of results and interpretation.<sup>4,15</sup> After reading the responses, analytical 
  categories were identified.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study was approved 
  by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the <i>Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o de Medicina 
  Tropical do Amazonas</i> (State of Amazonas Tropical Medicine Foundation - process 
  2939/2008). On the first course day, all teachers were adequately informed about 
  the research objectives and they signed an informed consent form for participation, 
  recording and dissemination of images.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of the 46 teachers 
  who participated in the course, 14 (30.4%) were women and 32 (69.6%) were men. 
  Participants were aged between 18 and 52 years, with a mean age of 29 years. 
  The median of time working as a teacher was three years; four (8.7%) participants 
  reported not having experience, because they had just been hired; five individuals 
  (10.8%) had more than 20 years of experience in teaching.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of all teachers, 
  39 (84.8%) worked in the rural area and seven in the urban area (15.2%); 45.7% 
  of them (21/46) worked in multi-grade classes of primary education (from the 
  first to the fourth grades); 19.6% (9/46) in the first grade of primary education; 
  6.5% (3/46) in preschool; 4.3% (2/46) in the second grade, third and fifth grades 
  of primary education; and 10.9% (5/46) did not know this information, because 
  they were in the process of being hired at the moment of the course.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A total of 18 (31%) 
  teachers had previously received training in health education, of which seven 
  (7/18, 38.9%) participated in courses on sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS, 
  and five (5/18, 29.4%) on malaria.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With regard to 
  general knowledge of health and school performance in disease prevention, teachers 
  were asked an open-ended question about the definition of health; before the 
  course, there were seven answers in blank; after the course, five. The most 
  frequent responses before the course were more general and associated with a 
  concept of lack of disease or well-being, reproducing the concepts promoted 
  by the World Health Organization (WHO) in a limited way: health as the absence 
  of disease - "Health is not to be infected by diseases"; health as a possibility/willingness 
  to act - "Health is willingness to do all activities: work, leisure, friends"; 
  and health as an expression of feelings - "Health is to be happy and to have 
  no concerns".</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By comparing pre-course 
  and post-course responses, a change in the statements of certain teachers can 
  be observed, showing that prevention was more valued: "Health is to be at peace 
  with life and to have good information about disease prevention"; "Health is 
  to care for yourself physically and mentally, to have love and to prevent diseases". 
  In addition, after the course, ideas associating health and social, intellectual 
  and spiritual well-being were more frequent, referring to the importance of 
  a healthy environment, higher value of knowledge and information, and responsibility 
  for the well-being of all: "Health is to have access to society, being aware 
  of health problems to help oneself and others"; "Health is to care for your 
  body and to care for the health of the population, fighting for the well-being 
  of all". In addition, participants reported hygiene and food care practices: 
  "To be healthy is to be clean, that is, to be hygienic". It means to care for 
  aspects such as cooking food well, washing fruits, and not walking barefoot". 
  Although general concepts of well-being remained, some responses suggested that 
  the reflections made during the course could have contributed to the broadening 
  of the concept of health and, especially, to ideas about prevention, humanization 
  and exercise of citizenship rights, as observed in the following report: "Health 
  is to care for the environment where we live, it is to demand that the government 
  provide basic sanitation, employment and housing, among other things".</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 52 responses 
  to the question "how can the school contribute to health?" also showed changes 
  before and after the course, thus suggesting the effect of reflection promoted 
  in the classes. This reflection was based on texts and activities present in 
  the course, with an emphasis on Health Promoting Schools. Before the course, 
  seven blank responses and one "I don't know" response were recorded, whereas 
  there were only two blank responses after the course. The greater emphasis observed 
  in eight responses given before the course was on the recommendation for lectures 
  as a means of health information in the school, some of which would be given 
  by health professionals, thus delegating this role to participants from outside 
  of the school: "By having lectures with people who understand about diseases"; 
  "In the countryside, teachers have to bring primary health agents to give information 
  about diseases". In addition, "to transmit" and "to pass on" (knowledge) were 
  verbs present in the pre-course responses: "By passing on the content to the 
  students, who take this to their families"; "By transmitting knowledge of this 
  disease to other people who don't have such knowledge". Some responses referred 
  to preventing diseases and valuing community actions: "Schools have a key role 
  so that, in the future, students learn about certain diseases and the ways to 
  prevent them".</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After the course, 
  although lectures continued to be mentioned, other alternatives were reported, 
  such as: organizing theater plays, telling stories, forming mutual-aid groups, 
  handing out pamphlets, using booklets and posters, holding meetings, and developing 
  health education projects. These actions were present in the workshops of the 
  course and included in the responses: "People in schools can and should organize 
  themselves and be united so that, as a group, they can create projects to fight 
  this disease"; "Schools can contribute with lectures, theater plays, and story-telling 
  inside their facilities and in the community". In addition, after the course, 
  the words "information", "awareness", "sensitization" and "partnerships" also 
  appeared: "By sensitizing the community with lectures, booklets and posters 
  to prevent these diseases, apart from health education". The question about 
  the contribution of the teacher's role to health showed changes. Before the 
  course, there were short responses such as "To guide", "To be the mediator", 
  and "To encourage". After the course, short responses were as follows: "To raise 
  people's awareness in the community"; "To contribute by playing your role as 
  an educator". Broader ideas that emphasize the educator's social role appear 
  after the course, such as: "To contribute to my students' critical and participatory 
  education, so they can take advantage of modern society and perform in it in 
  a critical and responsible way". Furthermore, after the course, prevention was 
  frequently mentioned: "To inform and to prepare important prevention partners"; 
  "To make students acquire knowledge and put it into practice in their daily 
  lives"; "To sensitize the population at risk to how they can prevent such diseases".</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Before the course, 
  teachers expressed short concepts such as teaching, explaining, acting, guiding, 
  clarifying and promoting lectures, restricting themselves to the classroom and 
  transmission of contents about hygiene, health, diseases and prevention. After 
  the course, however, there was greater empowerment of the function of the teacher 
  not only in the classroom, but also as part of society, with new attributions 
  such as: "To be someone who transmits knowledge"; "To prepare individuals for 
  society"; "To pass on the knowledge received in courses to the community in 
  which one works"; "To take themes seriously and work with an interdisciplinary 
  approach". One response showed a more elaborate position, reflecting the emphasis 
  discussed throughout the course: "To prepare critical citizens who are capable 
  of performing in modern society. To collaborate with other institutions so that 
  the school education is also directed towards key current points, to know the 
  local reality from the beginning, and participates in it".</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With regard to 
  knowledge of malaria, all teachers had previously heard of this disease, although 
  only 48.3% of them correctly identified its three typical symptoms (chills, 
  fever and sweating) before the course; 82.6% (p=0.00046) could give correct 
  responses after the course (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2931t01.jpg">Table 1</a>). When 
  assessing transmission mechanisms, 50% and 73.3% gave correct responses before 
  and after the course respectively (p=0.0181). Among previous concepts, incorrect 
  ideas were mainly associated with dengue virus transmission mechanisms (<a href="#t2">Table 
  2</a>).</font></p>
<p><a name="t2"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2931t02.jpg"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In terms of malaria 
  prevention measures, 19% and 69.6% gave correct responses before and after the 
  course respectively (p=0.000001) (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2931t01.jpg">Table 1</a>). 
  The main incorrect concepts found before the course were those about dengue 
  fever prevention (how to prevent water from accumulating in flower pots, tires 
  and sewage, and how to prevent garbage accumulation near houses) and patient 
  diagnostic and treatment actions (<a href="#t2">Table 2</a>). However, after 
  the course, there were more complete ideas of prevention, revealing the construction 
  of new knowledge: "Cleaning the areas that promote the spread of malaria focus, 
  putting mosquito nets in the houses, avoiding exposure during the times when 
  mosquitoes transmit the disease"; "Using mosquito nets and avoiding exposure 
  during the times that mosquitoes bite"; "Not staying close to streams and rivers 
  between 6.00 and 7.00pm"; "Sleeping under a mosquito net".</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With regard to 
  knowledge of the vector mosquito, the majority of teachers (94.3% and 97.7% 
  before and after the course, respectively) answered that they knew the <i>muri&ccedil;oca</i> 
  or <i>carapan&atilde;</i> (local names to describe the <i>Anopheles</i> mosquito); 
  however, before the course, 61.4% mentioned that this mosquito caused a disease, 
  a figure that rose to 94.6% after the course (p=0.000005). Before the course, 
  only 29.8% of teachers associated the vector with malaria transmission, while 
  knowledge of this fact increased to 76.5% after the course (p=0.00011) (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2931t01.jpg">Table 
  1</a>). After the course, some teachers showed that they had learned the scientific 
  name of the mosquito, used the word vector and associated the female mosquito 
  bite with transmission.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although the municipality 
  of Barcelos is a highly endemic area for malaria, teachers had little information 
  about transmission mechanisms, vectors and means of prevention. This is a concerning 
  fact, because teachers can disseminate incorrect or inadequate information to 
  their students, thus having repercussions for the development of an educational 
  strategy with actions aimed at schools.<sup>16</sup> Our research group has 
  shown that the school, despite its being an important space - and at times the 
  only one - of knowledge construction in endemic rural areas, is not fulfilling 
  this key role.<a name="topc"></a><a href="#backc"><sup>c</sup></a> New educational 
  practices are required, with the production of educational materials that are 
  adequate for the physical, social and cultural environment of these populations.<a href="#backb"><sup>b</sup></a> 
  A study on images<a href="#backa">ª</a> found in school biology books that are 
  associated with malaria reveals language complexity and errors that could promote 
  memorization, rather than learning. In the present study, authors suggest that 
  books should mention that "mosquitoes" are also locally known as "<i>pernilongo</i>", 
  "<i>muri&ccedil;oca</i>" and "<i>carapan&atilde;</i>", a fact which is not included 
  in the majority of texts analyzed, emphasizing the need for teacher training 
  and continuing education processes. Researchers in this study believe in inter-sectoral 
  partnerships (health, education and environment) to produce materials adapted 
  to each reality.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Results of this 
  study are similar to those found in the general population of Colombia<sup>13</sup> 
  and Mexico.<sup>21</sup> Studies conducted by Lipowsky et al<sup>13</sup> (1992) 
  and Rodriguez et al<sup>21</sup> (2003) also refer to inadequate educational 
  processes, because knowledge is not contextualized in the local reality. This 
  type of knowledge does not lead to prevention practices and these authors emphasize 
  the need for more studies that can result in the understanding of behavioral 
  factors of the populations exposed to malaria, aiming at greater adequacy of 
  control interventions. A study conducted in the Colombian Amazon revealed that 
  individuals may even know about the etiology, symptoms and treatment of malaria, 
  but they do not put control actions into practice.<sup>19</sup> Similar results 
  were found in highly endemic areas in Africa<sup>8,12</sup> and Asia.<sup>17</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the specific 
  case of malaria, among hundreds of articles available in the SciELO online database, 
  there were two including educational intervention results. One of them assessed 
  the promising strategy known as "<i>El mundo de la malaria</i>" (The malaria 
  world), which combined environmental and educational interventions to improve 
  knowledge and promote disease prevention behavior changes, resulting in social 
  mobilization and community participation in health promotion, especially in 
  rural areas.<sup>2</sup> Results were encouraging, with an increase in knowledge 
  and adherence to the use of mosquito nets impregnated with pyrethroids and adequate 
  treatment. In another study, authors observed that there was not only an increase 
  in knowledge and prevention practices, but also a 25% reduction in the number 
  of new malaria cases in the group that participated in the educational process, 
  as opposed to 17% in the control group, six years after the intervention.<sup>3</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the present 
  study, the increase in knowledge and reflections on the role of teachers in 
  the dissemination of knowledge reveals the importance of their qualification 
  improvement processes. This requires continuing education actions<sup>2,3,17</sup> 
  in the sense of prevention practice dissemination and mobilization of students 
  and their families in the disease control process. As observed in the post-course 
  results, although there has been an increase in the scope of more interactive 
  and participatory practices and concepts, the responses of some teachers reveal 
  the persistence of a type of education based on knowledge transmission, rather 
  than the joint construction of this knowledge using activities such as workshops, 
  meetings, interactive projects and field visits with the students. These activities 
  were emphasized and practiced throughout the course as relevant for a type of 
  education which is contextualized and committed to health promotion. There is 
  the need to replace the prescriptive approach of lectures for more participatory 
  practices, such as workshops performed with the school community, thus gathering 
  scientific and folk knowledge. Such observation indicates the need for greater 
  investment in educational processes for teachers, so that their role in health 
  education is increased, with a closer relationship between knowledge and practice 
  and greater critical understanding of reality.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Continuous work 
  is key for teachers to disseminate the knowledge they have acquired in the educational 
  interventions and, thus, to promote their commitment and that of their students 
  and their students' families to health promotion and endemic disease prevention 
  practices and attitudes.<sup>14</sup> In highly endemic areas for malaria, the 
  inclusion of malaria studies in the school curriculum is recommended, with practices 
  and contents adapted to the local reality. An integrated strategy to control 
  malaria must take into consideration the importance of the educational sector 
  as a source of knowledge to bring about attitudes and practices that are adequate 
  for malaria prevention and control. The <i>Estrat&eacute;gia de Escolas Promotoras 
  de Sa&uacute;de</i> (Health-Promoting School Strategy), which appeared in the 
  late 1980s, can provide important resources for more dialogical practices. The 
  reason for this is that health promotion is viewed as a comprehensive approach, 
  comprised of the following three interrelated components: health education, 
  including the development of abilities for life; creation and maintenance of 
  healthy environments; and the offer of healthcare services, food and a healthy 
  life.<a name="topd"></a><a href="#backd"><sup>d</sup></a></font></p>
