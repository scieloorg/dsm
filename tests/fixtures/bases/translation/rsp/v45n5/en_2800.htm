<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> 
  To assess the prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and related 
  risk factors.<br>
  <b>METHODS:</b> A population-based cross-sectional study with 1,441 individuals 
  of both sexes aged 40 years or more was conducted in the city of S&atilde;o 
  Paulo, Brazil, between 2008 and 2009. A two-stage (census tract, household)

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chronic obstructive 
  pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by airflow limitation that is usually 
  not fully reversible, progressive and associated with abnormal inflammatory 
  response in the lungs to inhaled harmful particles or gases. The main risk factors 
  for COPD include cigarette smoking, inhalation of occupational dusts, chemical 
  irritants, and environmental pollution, low socioeconomic condition and severe 
  respiratory infections during childhood.<sup>2</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chronic inflammation 
  of the lungs can result in damage to the bronchi (chronic bronchitis) and cause 
  lung parenchyma destruction (emphysema) with consequent reduced elasticity. 
  Lung damage varies among individuals as well as symptom presentation. COPD symptoms 
  include chronic cough, sputum production and dyspnea on exertion. Although COPD 
  mainly affects the lungs, it also has significant systemic cardiovascular and 
  musculoskeletal consequences. COPD changes are characterized by inflammation, 
  mucus hypersecretion, smooth muscle contraction of the airways, bronchial wall 
  thickening, loss of elastic recoil and alveolar destruction, leading to airflow 
  limitation, inadequate ventilation-perfusion ratio and pulmonary hyperinflation. 
  COPD comprises chronic bronchitis and emphysema but not asthma. These two conditions 
  are individually defined: chronic bronchitis refers to the presence of cough 
  and sputum production for at least three months during two consecutive years, 
  and emphysema is defined by alveolar destruction.<sup>2</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">COPD is a major 
  cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and imparts substantial economic 
  burden on individuals and health systems. Direct costs include medical (drugs, 
  tests, consultations and hospital services) and non-medical expenses (transportation 
  and rental/purchase of home equipment). Indirect costs are caused by reduced 
  or lost productivity due to the disease or early death. Given COPD prevalence 
  and its impact, the estimated disease-related cost is US$ 1,522.00 per patient 
  per year, almost three times the cost per asthma patient.<sup>5</sup> Data from 
  a prospective cohort of 1,510 patients with COPD followed up in Spain during 
  the year of 2000 showed that the annual costs were US$ 2,911 for severe, US$ 
  2047 for moderate and US$ 1,484 for mild patients. <sup>20</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Halbert et al<sup>10</sup> 
  (2003) assessed the prevalence of COPD in 17 cities in Europe and North America 
  after reviewing 32 articles published between 1961 and 2001. The prevalences 
  ranged from 4% to 10% and they were estimated based on spirometry results, respiratory 
  symptoms and self-reported disease.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The prevalence 
  of COPD was between 6% and 15.8% in S&atilde;o Paulo in 2003 based on spirometry 
  diagnostic criteria.<sup>18</sup> In Latin America, the prevalence ranged from 
  7.8% in Mexico City, Mexico, to 19.7 % in Montevideo, Uruguay.<sup>19</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is great 
  scarcity of information on COPD prevalence and associated factors. The major 
  risk factor for COPD is cigarette smoking. Pipe and cigar smoking and other 
  popular forms of tobacco consumption are also factors associated with COPD. 
  Other factors include occupational dusts and chemicals; indoor air pollution 
  from wood stoves used for cooking and heating in poorly ventilated dwellings; 
  outdoor pollution, which adds to the overall effects of inhaled particles on 
  the lungs, though its role in COPD is not yet understood; and passive smoking, 
  which can also contribute to respiratory symptoms and COPD.<sup>2,17</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the United States, 
  COPD is the fourth leading cause of death and a leading cause of morbidity and 
  disability. There were about 715,000 hospitalizations due to COPD in 2005.<sup>1</sup> 
  According to the most recent consensus on COPD in Brazil,<sup>2</sup> it was 
  the fifth leading cause of hospitalization in the public health system in people 
  over 40 in 2003, with 196,698 hospitalizations and a cost of approximately R$ 
  72 million. The number of deaths from COPD in Brazil was 38,000 people per year, 
  ranking between the fifth and sixth leading cause of death (excluding violent 
  deaths). Between 1997 and 2007 mortality from COPD increased by 24.3%.<a name="topa"></a><a href="#backa">ª</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Given the importance 
  of this condition in Brazil, the present study aimed to assess the prevalence 
  of COPD and factors associated.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A cross-sectional 
  population-based study was conducted using data from the 2008 Health Survey 
  of the City of S&atilde;o Paulo (ISA-Capital 2008) between 2008 and 2009. A 
  total of 3,271 adults of both sexes aged 40 years or more were selected and 
  the final sample consisted of 1,441 individuals.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A two-stage (census 
  tract, household) cluster random sampling stratified by sex and age was used. 
  Seventy census tracts were randomly selected from the 267 urban census tracts 
  in the city of S&atilde;o Paulo sampled in the Brazilian Household Survey (<i>Pesquisa 
  Nacional por Amostra de Domic&iacute;lios,</i> PNAD-2002).<a name="topb"></a><a href="#backb"><sup>b</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Data was collected 
  through a structured questionnaire comprising 21 thematic groups with mostly 
  closed questions.<a name="topc"></a><a href="#backc"><sup>c</sup></a> All interviews 
  were conducted by trained staff that was supervised throughout the study. Interviews 
  by phone or at home were performed in a random sample of 5% of the respondents 
  to ensure quality of data collection. The non-response rate was 22.5%; in 7.3% 
  of the selected households no dweller was found or they refused to inform whether 
  any of the dwellers was in the age group of interest.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The dependent variable 
  was self-reported COPD (yes/no). The independent variables selected for the 
  analysis were:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">demographic and 
  socioeconomic characteristics: gender; age; race/skin color; marital status; 
  schooling; family income; housing conditions; type of housing; number of rooms 
  in the household and sewage disposal;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lifestyle variables 
  included: smoking; number of cigarettes smoked per day; years of smoking; number 
  of cigarettes smoked in their lifetime, calculated by the average number of 
  cigarettes smoked per day and the number of years of smoking; alcohol dependence 
  evaluated using the Cut-down, Annoyed by Criticism, Guilty and Eye Opener (CAGE) 
  questionnaire; and leisure-time physical activity;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Health-related 
  variables included: body mass index (BMI) calculated based on weight and height 
  information provided; sleep, assessed through the items "sleeps badly" / "feel 
  tired all the time" / "get easily tired" of the Self-Report Questionnaire (SRQ-20); 
  hospitalization in the 12 months prior to interview; length of hospital stay; 
  health problems in the 15 days preceding the interview; and self-reported medical 
  conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, allergies, rhinitis, anemia, back 
  pain, arthritis/ rheumatic disease, chronic kidney disease, stroke, depression/anxiety/mental 
  problems, osteoporosis and heart disease.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The association 
  between independent variables and COPD was assessed in the bivariate analysis 
  with the use of </font><font size="2">&#967;</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><sup>2</sup> 
  test at a 5% significance level. Prevalence ratios (PR) and related 95% confidence 
  intervals (95%CI) were estimated and an adjusted Poisson multiple regression 
  analysis was performed. The multiple regression model included the variables 
  with p&lt;0.20 in the bivariate analysis and only those with p&lt;0.05 remained 
  in the model. Interactions between the variables in the final model were also 
  examined. The design effects for the analysis of complex survey data were also 
  examined.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The analyses were 
  carried out in SPSS 16.0 that allows to analyzing observations of different 
  weights.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study was approved 
  by the Research Ethics Committee of the Universidade de S&atilde;o Paulo School 
  of Public Health (protocol #381/2001). All respondents signed a consent form 
  informing the purposes of the study and information requested and ensuring confidentiality 
  of all information provided.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of the 1,441 respondents 
  aged 40 years or more, 55.6% were female, 66.3% were white and 69.4% had a partner. 
  Of all, 44% elementary education and 27.9% middle/high school education. Sixty-eight 
  percent reported living in a house, 73.7% were home owners and 71.7% lived in 
  households with four or more rooms (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2800t01.jpg">Table 1</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The estimated prevalence 
  of self-reported COPD was 4.2% (95%CI 3.1;5.4). The variables associated with 
  COPD in the crude analysis were: age (p&lt;0.030); number of cigarettes smoked 
  in their lifetime (p&lt;0.001); feel tired all the time (p=0.011); get easily

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The estimated prevalence 
  of self-reported COPD was 4.2% (95%CI 3.1;5.4%). Data on the prevalence of COPD 
  in Latin America is relatively scarce. The only study published in Brazil until 
  2004 was carried out in Pelotas, southern Brazil.<sup>17</sup> It was a cross-sectional 
  study with a random sample of 1,053 people over 40 years that estimated the 
  prevalence of chronic bronchitis diagnosed based on the classical clinical criteria. 
  It was found a prevalence of 12.7% of chronic bronchitis in this sample. Although 
  it was an important study on the epidemiology of chronic bronchitis in Brazil, 
  emphysema was not investigated and thus the prevalence of COPD was not assessed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Platino Project 
  was a cross-sectional population-based study that assessed the prevalence of 
  COPD in 2003. S&atilde;o Paulo was the first city studied and, based on the 
  diagnostic spirometry criteria used, the prevalence ranged between 6%<sup>17</sup> 
  and 19.7%<sup>18</sup> in Latin America.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Halbert 
  et al<sup>11</sup> (2006), the prevalence of COPD diagnosed by spirometry was 
  9.2% (95%CI 7.7;11.0) in 37 studies and the prevalence of self-reported COPD 
  was 4.9 (95%CI 2.8;8.3) in seven studies, consistent with that found in the 
  present study.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The interaction 
  between exposure to environmental risk factors such as cigarette smoking, and 
  individual factors is key for the development of COPD.<sup>14</sup> Individual 
  factors include alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, 
  malnutrition, prematurity and recurrent respiratory infections.<sup>2</sup> 
  Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disorder that occurs in 3% to 10% 
  of the Caucasian population and is associated with COPD.<sup>14</sup> In 1963,<sup>15</sup> 
  Laurell &amp; Eriksson showed that individuals with deficiency of this lung-protective 
  protein had an increased prevalence of emphysema as they were unable to inhibit 
  neutrophil elastase action allowing it to destroy lung parenchyma. Although 
  there is no evidence of the role of genetic variation in the development of 
  COPD, some authors claim that genetic inheritance may be involved in up to 40% 
  of cases of chronic bronchitis.<sup>9</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The most important 
  risk factor for COPD is cigarette smoking. Pipe and cigar smoking and other 
  forms of tobacco consumption are also risk factors. In the present study, the 
  PR of the number of cigarettes smoked in their lifetime (&gt;1,500) was 3.9 
  times greater among those with COPD compared to those who never smoked. The 
  Platino Project showed that smokers had a PR of 2.04 (95%CI: 1.41;2.95) for 
  COPD compared with nonsmokers in S&atilde;o Paulo in 2003.<sup>18</sup> The 
  Second Brazilian Consensus on COPD<sup>2</sup> reported that approximately 15 
  % of smokers develop COPD, and this proportion is likely to be underestimated. 
  A cohort study<sup>16</sup> with 8,045 individuals followed up for 25 years 
  in the city of Copenhagen, Denmark, estimated that 25% of smokers developed 
  COPD during this follow-up period.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The highest prevalence 
  of COPD are found between the sixth and seventh decade of life.<sup>17,18</sup> 
  The present study showed that, regardless of the number of cigarettes smoked 
  in their lifetime, individuals aged <u>&gt;</u>60 years had a significantly 
  higher prevalence of COPD. The natural history of chronic airflow obstruction 
  shows that even individuals who have never smoked or are not susceptible to 
  the harmful effects of smoking have an average decline of 25% in their lung 
  function between 40 and 80 years of age.<sup>6</sup> The prevalence of COPD 
  was a 1.3 times higher in individuals who reported health problems in the 15 
  days preceding the interview compared with those who did not. The prevalence 
  ratio for COPD was 2.6 times higher among those who reported getting easily 
  tired compared to those who did not. COPD compromises lung mechanics, peripheral 
  muscles and cardiovascular system, which may explain their dyspnea and perception 
  of fatigue with exertion.<sup>8, 22,23</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Changes in lung 
  mechanics result from bronchial obstruction and air trapping in the lungs. This 
  pathophysiological process leads to lung hyperinflation over time, which progressively 
  reduces one's ability to physical exertion. The pathophysiological changes aggravate 
  as COPD progresses and patients develop limiting symptoms such as dyspnea. They 
  have reduced ability to perform daily life activities and consequently it creates 
  a vicious cycle as they limit their activities to mitigate the symptoms.<sup>22</sup> 
  Excessive resting make these patients decrease their physical fitness, which 
  is a main factor for muscle mass loss in COPD patients.<sup>8,23</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">COPD patients have 
  higher risk of cardiovascular death regardless of tobacco use. This phenomenon 
  may be explained by a common genetic predisposition to atherosclerosis and emphysema 
  because both are systemic inflammatory diseases.<sup>23</sup> Comorbidities 
  associated with systemic inflammation such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes 
  mellitus are usually seen in COPD patients. A recent study conducted in England 
  based on primary care records of 1,204,100 patients aged 35 and more found that 
  physician-diagnosed COPD was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular 
  disease (OR = 4.98, 95%CI 4.85;5.81), stroke (OR = 3.34, 95%CI 3.21;3.48) and 
  diabetes mellitus (OR = 2.04, 95%CI 1.97;2.12).<sup>4</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Respondents with 
  COPD showed lower levels of leisure-time physical activity (PR = 0.57, 95%CI 
  0.26;0.97). Because of physical inability caused by the disease and reduced 
  daily activities to mitigate the symptoms, COPD patients tend to spend most 
  of the day in the sitting position. Shortness of breath and early muscle fatigue 
  during any physical exertion may explain excessive resting in these patients.<sup>22</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Contrary to common 
  belief, it is highly recommended supervised exercise training at any stage of 
  the disease, and pulmonary rehabilitation aims to optimize the patient's physical 
  and social performance and autonomy. Pulmonary rehabilitation care has four 
  main components: drug treatment; respiratory muscle training; education program 
  with psychosocial and behavioral interventions; and exercise training. Pulmonary 
  rehabilitation in COPD patients can improve exercise ability and health-related 
  quality of life; reduce the perceived shortness of breath; reduce the number 
  of hospitalizations and days of hospital stay, and exercise training of upper 
  limb muscles can reduce the perceived shortness of breath.<sup>2</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Physical activity 
  can reduce the risk of developing COPD. A case-control study carried out in 
  Japan with 278 cases and 335 controls aged between 50 and 75 years concluded 
  that those who remained active throughout their life had better lung function 
  when compared to sedentary people. An adjusted OR = 0.59 (95%CI 0.36, 0.97) 
  for COPD and OR = 0.56 for dyspnea (95%CI 0.36,0.88) was found among those physically 
  active compared to those inactive.<sup>13</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The American College 
  of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines on 
  physical activity for adults recommend at least 30 minutes of moderate physical 
  activity (e.g., walking) five times a week or 20 minutes of vigorous physical 
  activity (e.g., brisk walking or running) three times a week for health maintenance 
  and promotion. Given the dose-response relationship between exercise and health, 
  individuals who wish to improve their physical fitness, reduce their risk of 
  chronic diseases and disabilities or prevent weight gain may benefit from exceeding 
  the minimum recommended level of physical activity.<sup>12</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Garcia-Aymerich 
  et al<sup>7</sup> (2005) followed up 6,790 adults for 10 years to assess the 
  association between physical activity and lung function decline and COPD risk 
  among smokers and nonsmokers. Among those individuals (smokers and nonsmokers) 
  who engaged in moderate to high levels of physical activity, the relative risk 
  for developing COPD was 0.80 (95%CI 0.65;0.98) compared with those with low 
  levels of physical activity. There was also seen a protective effect against 
  the development of COPD among current smokers who engaged in moderate to high 
  levels of physical activity with a relative risk of 0.77 (95%CI 0.61;0.97) compared 
  to those with low levels of physical activity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Physical activity 
  can prevent COPD regardless of smoking. The biological plausibility of the influence 
  of physical activity on lung function decline relies on the anti-inflammatory 
  effects of physical activity. Exercise training can reduce the levels of proinflammatory 
  cytokines (IL-6, TNF-</font><font size="2">&#945;</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  and C-reactive protein), increase the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines 
  (IL-4, IL-10 and TGF-</font><font size="2">&#946;</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">) 
  when compared to controls.<sup>3</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the study 
  limitations is the use of self-reported morbidity data because it can underestimate 
  the prevalence of respiratory conditions due to recall bias and/or undiagnosed 
  conditions. However, Mullerova et al<sup>21</sup> (2004) back the validity of 
  self-reports in epidemiological studies on respiratory diseases because data 
  has shown adequate sensitivity and specificity in population-based surveys, 
  as it may reflect indirectly the actual disease prevalence and constitute an 
  indirect indicator with good reliability. From an epidemiological perspective, 
  estimating the prevalence of self-reported respiratory disease in a population 
  is an easy, straightforward approach to obtain information on health status 
  and shows good agreement, reproducibility and cost-effective when considering 
  the results of clinical evaluations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cross-sectional 
  studies with complex sampling design are widely used in epidemiology. The use 
  of clusters leads to less accurate estimates of the variance than simple random 
  sampling, which in turn leads to less accurate results than a stratified sample. 
  Studies with complex sampling should provide accurate estimates of the parameters 
  studied and the design effect (Deff) assesses how well it was obtained considering 
  the variance between simple and complex random sampling. Besides being used 
  in the study planning for estimating the sample size, the Deff is used to assess 
  the error made when ignoring the complex sampling and analyzing the data as 
  if they were drawn by simple random sampling. The Deff is the "price" paid by 
  the researchers for having their task facilitated by investigating only randomly 
  selected clusters, which results in increased inaccuracy of the results due 
  to potential correlations of the sampling units within and between clusters.<sup>24</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present study 
  highlights the significant association of COPD with tobacco use and age over 
  60. Frequent health problems and reduced leisure-time physical activity can 
  be regarded as outcomes of this disease. In the light of the increasing trend 
  of COPD due to increasing longevity, early diagnosis and an education approach 
  to smoking cessation and physical activity promotion are extremely important 
  for improving health-related quality of life in these individuals and reducing 
  the economic impact of COPD to the health system.</font></p>
