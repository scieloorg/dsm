<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> 
  To evaluate sensitivity and specificity of different protocols for blood pressure 
  measurement for the diagnosis of hypertension in adults.<br>
  <b>METHODS: </b> Cross-sectional study conducted in a non-probabilistic sample 
  of 250 public servants of both sexes aged 35 to 74 years in Vit&oacute;ria, 
  southeastern Brazil, between 2008 and 2010. The participants had their blood 
  pressure measured using three different methods: clinic measurement, self-measured 
  and 24-hour ambulatory measurement. They were all interviewed to obtain sociodemographic 
  information and had their anthropometric data (weight, height, waist circumference) 
  collected. Clinic measurement and self-measured were analyzed against the gold 
  standard ambulatory measurement. Measures of diagnostic performance (sensitivity, 
  specificity, accuracy and positive and negative predictive values) were calculated. 
  The Bland &amp; Altman method was used to evaluate agreement between ambulatory 
  measurement (standard deviation for daytime measurements) and self-measured 
  (standard deviation of four measurements). A 5% significance level was used 
  for all analyses.<br>
  <b>RESULTS: </b> Self-measured blood pressure showed higher sensitivity (S=84%, 
  95%CI 75;93) and overall accuracy (0.817, p&lt;0.001) in the diagnosis of hypertension 
  than clinic measurement (S=79%, 95%CI 73;86, and overall accuracy=0.815, p&lt;0.001). 
  Despite the strong correlation with daytime ambulatory measurement values (r=0.843, 
  p&lt;0.001), self-measured values did not show good agreement with daytime systolic 
  ambulatory values (bias=5.82, 95%CI 4.49;7.15). Seven (2.8%) cases of white 
  coat hypertension, 26 (10.4%) of masked hypertension and 46 (18.4%) of white-coat 
  effect were identified.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS: </b> The study shows that self-measured blood pressure has higher 
  sensitivity than clinic measurement to identify true hypertension. The negative 
  predictive values found confirm the superiority of self-measured when compared 
  to clinic in identifying truly normotensive individuals. However, clinic measurement 
  cannot be replaced with self-measured, as it is still the most reliable method 
  for the diagnosis of hypertension.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJETIVO:</b> 
  Evaluar la sensibilidad y la especificidad de diferentes protocolos de medida 
  de la presión arterial para el diagnóstico de la hipertensión en adultos.<br>
  <b>MÉTODOS:</b> Estudio transversal con muestra no probabilística de 250 funcionarios 
  de ambos sexos de institución pública en el grupo etáreo de 35 a 74 años en 
  Vitoria, Sureste de Brasil, entre 2008 y 2010. Los participantes tuvieron sus 
  presiones arteriales medidas por tres métodos: medida clínica, automedida y 
  medida por ambulatorio por 24 horas. Se colectaron datos antropométricos (peso, 
  estatura y circunferencias) y se realizó entrevista. Los métodos fueron confrontados 
  y analizados con relación a la medida por ambulatorio 24h (patrón-oro). Se calcularon 
  las medidas de desempeño diagnóstico: sensibilidad, especificidad, valores predictivos 
  positivos y negativos y precisión. La metodología de Bland & Altman fue utilizada 
  para verificar la concordancia entre la variable presórica en la automedida 
  (desviación estándar de las cuatro medidas). Se adoptó nivel de 5% de significancia 
  para todas las pruebas.<br>
  <b>RESULTADOS:</b> La automedida presentó mayor sensibilidad (S=84%; IC95%: 
  75;93) y precisión global (0,817; p<0,001) en el diagnóstico de la hipertensión 
  que la medida clínica (S=79%; IC95%: 73,86 y AG = 0,815; p<0,001). A pesar de 
  la fuerte correlación con el método de medida por ambulatorio durante la vigilia 
  (r=0,843; p=0,000), la automedida no mostró buena concordancia con el referido 
  método para la medida sistólica (sesgo=5,82; IC95%: 4,49;7,15). Se identificaron 
  siete (2,8%) individuos con hipertensión de delantal blanco, 26 (10,4%) con 
  hipertensión enmascarada y 46 (18,4%) con efecto de delantal blanco.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONES:</b> Los resultados sugieren que la automedida presenta sensibilidad 
  superior a la medida clínica para identificar verdaderos hipertensos en la población. 
  Los valores de predicción negativa encontrados confirma la superioridad de la 
  automedida con relación a la medida clínica en lo que respecta a la capacidad 
  de la prueba en señalar los individuos verdaderamente normotensos. Sin embargo, 
  no puede sustituir la medida clínica, que aún es el método más fidedigno. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hypertension is 
  a major public health concern worldwide due to its high prevalence in the adult 
  population and strong impact on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.<sup>4,15</sup> 
  Although there is no cure for this condition, blood pressure control can be 
  achieved in most cases with general management associated or not with drug therapy.<a name="topa"></a><a href="#backa">ª</a> 
  An almost normal survival can be achieved in hypertensive patients<sup>18,19</sup> 
  when management is based on an accurate diagnosis as antihypertensive drugs 
  produce major side effects, especially when chronically used.<sup>16</sup> Epidemiologically 
  speaking, reducing false-positive and false-negative rates should be a priority 
  goal while approaching hypertension as it can optimize management, prevents 
  the effects of unnecessary drug use and thus reduce health care costs and improve 
  quality of life.<sup>7,10,11</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although the diagnosis 
  of hypertension is apparently straightforward, it may be affected by factors 
  related to the examiner, instrument used, environment and the very patient.<sup>7</sup> 
  Some patients may experience stress that is strongly influenced by the presence 
  of a medical examiner and have unintentionally elevated blood pressure (BP) 
  levels during assessment resulting in false positive (white coat hypertension)<sup>17</sup> 
  or false negative (white-coat effect) diagnosis.<sup>16</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More recently the 
  use of oscillometric devices has improved blood pressure assessment and allowed 
  standardizing home monitoring of blood pressure and self-measured blood pressure 
  (SMBP).<sup>8</sup> SMBP allows patients to measuring their BP in an environment 
  where they spend most of their time, for example, at work.<sup>1</sup> The appropriate 
  use of these devices could reduce false positives as elevated blood pressure 
  due to stress would be minimized with blood pressure assessment in environments 
  other than hospitals and medical offices (clinic measurement of blood pressure, 
  CMBP).<sup>1,9</sup> However, ambulatory measurement of blood pressure (AMBP) 
  is still superior to SMBP and CMBP because it provides an automated measurement 
  and allows prolonged (e.g., 24-h) monitoring as well.<sup>12</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although SMBP is 
  a more affordable method than AMBP<sup>6</sup> and can provide a larger number 
  of measures compared to CMBP,<sup>1</sup> few studies have compared blood pressure 
  measurements obtained with these different methods.<sup>14,17</sup> There are 
  numerous issues related to blood pressure assessment and it is therefore critical 
  to establish the actual effectiveness of the currently used methods.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present study 
  aimed to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of different protocols for blood 
  pressure measurement for the diagnosis of hypertension in adults.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This cross-sectional 
  study was developed as part of the Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA 
  Brazil). The ELSA Brasil study was designed to investigate chronic disease determinants 
  in the Brazilian population with main focus on cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.<a name="topb"></a><a href="#backb"><sup>b</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study participants 
  were active or retired public servants of the Universidade Federal do Esp&iacute;rito 
  Santo aged 35 to 74 years. The sample size was estimated to detect a 3-mmHg 
  difference in mean blood pressure using different measurement methods, an alpha 
  error of 5% and a statistical power of 90%. Assuming a loss of 20%, the estimated 
  sample size was 248 individuals. ELSA Brasil participants who had completed 
  all previous stages of the study project were invited to participate in this 
  substudy. Those participants whose anthropometric characteristics (left arm 
  circumference greater than 50 cm or lower than 17 cm) were not suitable for 
  AMBP and SMBP were excluded from the study.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Data was collected 
  at the ELSA-ES Research Center. The study sample comprised 255 individuals but 
  four were excluded from the analysis because they did not complete the set number 
  of AMBP (16 valid measurements during daytime and eight during sleep).<sup>15</sup> 
  Another participant was excluded for not having taken SMBP as established by 
  the protocol. The final sample consisted of data from 250 individuals studied 
  between 2008 and 2010.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The body mass index 
  (BMI) was calculated as the ratio between weight (kg) and height (m<sup>2</sup>) 
  and the recommended World Health Organization (WHO)<sup>20</sup> cutoffs were 
  used. Anthropometric measurements were made according to international recommendations.<sup>20</sup> 
  Weight was measured using an electronic scale (Toledo&#174;) with capacity of 
  200 kg and height was measured with a stadiometer (Seca&#174;) with precision 
  of 0.1 cm and bulb level.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Measures of waist 
  circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC) and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) 
  were obtained using an inelastic, flexible tape placed in contact with the skin 
  but without compressing tissues. WC was taken at the midpoint between the lower 
  margin of the rib and the iliac crest in the midaxillary line; HC was taken 
  by positioning the tape at the greatest protuberance of the buttocks. MUAC was 
  measured as follows: the participant was in a standing position and his/her 
  arm was positioned with the elbow flexed at 90&#176; and palm facing up. The 
  measure was taken from the lateral aspect of the acromion (bony edge of the 
  shoulder) to the olecranon (elbow tip).<a name="topc"></a><a href="#backc"><sup>c</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All participants 
  were interviewed using a questionnaire on sociodemographic and health-related 
  information. The variable race/skin color was self-reported.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The CMBP was taken 
  using a validated oscillometric device (Onrom, model 705CP-Intelissense&#174;). 
  Participants were asked to empty their bladder and do not eat, drink (including 
  coffee) and smoke 30 minutes before the assessment. With the participant in 
  a sitting position after resting for at least five minutes, three readings were 
  made concomitantly in each arm according to the Brazilian Society of Hypertension 
  criteria.<sup>16</sup> BP in each arm was calculated as the arithmetic average 
  of the two last readings and classified according to the readings obtained in 
  the arm with the highest BP.<sup>16</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Following CMBP 
  an ambulatory blood pressure monitoring device (Spacelabs 2000&#174;) was placed 
  on left arm and programmed to perform automatic measurements every 15 minutes 
  during daytime and every 30 minutes during sleep (10 p.m. to 6 a.m.). Mean systolic 
  and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were automatically recorded for 
  each participant for a 24-hour period, during daytime and nighttime. Each participant 
  was then given a validated oscillometric device (Omron 705CP-Intelissense&#174;) 
  for home measurement of blood pressure. They were instructed on measurement 
  procedures and to keep a "monitoring log." Four BP readings were programmed 
  to be made between 11 a.m. and 12 p.m., 5 p.m. and 6 p.m., 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. 
  and 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. the next morning. The readings on the instrument's display 
  were to be recorded in the participant's log, but they were automatically saved 
  on the instrument as well. Each participant was instructed to perform one reading 
  at each time point and only repeat it five minutes later if there was an error. 
  They were also advised to make the reading in a quiet environment, comfortably 
  sitting and resting their arm and feet.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All instructions 
  for SMBP were given by the same nurse during a 45-minute session. Participants 
  were asked to perform the entire procedure to show they felt comfortable with 
  it. This was intended to reduce the participant's anxiety related to the instrument's 
  use<sup>1</sup> -a determinant factor to prevent false-positive results. It 
  should be noted that the study sample included individuals with all levels of 
  schooling. Only one set of readings was not validated due to inconsistent procedure 
  and was excluded from the study.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SMBP was considered 
  adequate when four valid readings were recorded in the instrument's memory at 
  the preset time points. The participant's SMBP was calculated as the average 
  of these four readings. Hypertension was diagnosed based on each BP measurement 
  method used according to the VI Brazilian Guideline on Hypertension.<sup>18</sup> 
  For daytime SMBP and AMBP hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure 
  (SBP) <u>&gt;</u>135 or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) <u>&gt;</u>85. For 24-h 
  AMBP and AMBP hypertension was defined as SBP <u>&gt;</u>130 or DBP <u>&gt;</u> 
  80 and SBP <u>&gt;</u>140 or DBP <u>&gt;</u>90, respectively.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For identifying 
  white coat hypertension (false positives), masked hypertension and white-coat 
  effect (false negatives), the following combinations of methods were used: SMBP 
  and CMBP as the method tested; AMBP and CMBP as the gold standard for the three 
  conditions described above.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the statistical 
  analysis categorical variables were described as percentages. The chi-square 
  test (</font><font size="2">&#935;</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#178;) 
  was used to test the hypothesis of homogeneity of proportions. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
  test was used to assess the normality of continuous variables. Measures of diagnostic 
  performance (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, 
  and accuracy) were calculated using 24-h AMBP as the gold standard. The Bland 
  &amp; Altman methodology<sup>3,5</sup> was used to assess the agreement between 
  AMBP (daytime standard deviation) and SMBP (standard deviation of four measures). 
  The level of significance for all tests was set at 5%. All statistical analyses 
  were performed with SPSS for Windows (version 17.0) and Epidat 3.0.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study was approved 
  by the Research Ethics Committee of the Center for Health Sciences at Universidade 
  Federal do Esp&iacute;rito Santo (protocol no. 140/08). All participants signed 
  an informed consent form.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sociodemographic 
  characteristics of participants according to BP classification determined by 
  24-h AMBP are shown in <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2552t01.jpg">Table 1</a>. There were 
  significant differences in gender, race/skin color, age, height, weight and 
  diagnosis of hypertension (p&lt;0.05). Hypertensive participants showed higher 
  mean age (55.9, SD = 8.7) compared to normotensive (53.2, SD = 9.7). There were 
  no significant differences in WC (p = 0.891) and HC (p = 0.425) among hypertensive 
  women and BMI in hypertensive men (p = 0.099).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2552t02.jpg">Table 
  2</a> shows that SMBP and CMBP showed similar sensitivity whereas CMBP had higher 
  specificity. Also, both methods showed similar accuracy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The specificity 
  and accuracy of SMBP to identify white coat hypertension, masked hypertension 
  and white-coat effect were high (&gt;80%) but their sensitivity was relatively 
  low (55% to 59%). Of all 250 participants, 77 (30.8%) were classified as hypertensive 
  using AMBP, 63 (25.2%) using CMBP and 99 (36.9%) using SMBP.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The negative predictive 
  value (NPV) of SMBP was greater than CMBP (92% vs. 88%) and the positive predictive 
  values (PPV) of SMBP and CMBP were 64% and 83%, respectively. On the other hand, 
  CMBP showed higher accuracy (86%) than SMBP (81%).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2552t02.jpg">Table 
  2</a> shows a comparison of the performance of two BP measurement methods to 
  identify white coat hypertension, masked hypertension and white-coat effect. 
  There were identified seven (2.8%) participants with white coat hypertension, 
  26 (10.4%) with masked hypertension and 46 (18.4%) with white-coat effect. The 
  sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and accuracy 
  for identifying a white-coat effect were 59%, 84%, 45%, 90% and 79%, respectively.</font></p>

  <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2552f01.jpg">Figure 1a</a> shows that BP measures had a strong 
  correlation (r = 0.843, p&lt;0.001) but they did not show good agreement as 
  the Bland &amp; Altman plot (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2552f01.jpg">Figure 1b</a>) 
  indicates statistically significant bias (<i>d</i>) (<i>d</i> = 5.82, 95%CI:

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2552f02.jpg">Figure 
  2</a> shows that mean DBP measured using daytime AMBP and SMBP were also correlated 
  (r = 0.821, p&lt;0.001, <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2552f02.jpg">Figure 2a</a>). However, 
  the means in <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2552f02.jpg">Figure 2b</a> showed good agreement 
  as bias is almost zero and not statistically significant (<i>d</i> = 0.41, 95%CI: 
  -0.38;1.21).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study results 
  suggest that SMBP has higher sensitivity than CMBP to identify true hypertension 
  in the general population as this is a highly prevalent condition. The NPVs 
  found support the finding that SMBP is superior to CMBP to identify truly normotensive 
  individuals.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The method tested 
  for identifying white coat hypertension showed greater specificity than sensitivity, 
  and good diagnostic ability evidences through high accuracy and agreement, and 
  a NPV indicating low false-negative rates. The results with the same combination 
  (SMBP and CMBP) used for identifying masked hypertension and white coat effect 
  suggest that a similar performance to that seen for white coat hypertension.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since SMBP do not 
  follow a standard protocol time points of BP measures and number of steps required 
  to establish the most accurate diagnosis are set at the physician's and patient's 
  discretion.<sup>1,15</sup> Thus, a wide range of methodological approaches have 
  been investigated, making it difficult comparison with other studies. However, 
  the present study allows a comparison of performance of the three methods studied. 
  One limitation of this study is the high number of participants taking antihypertensive 
  drugs, which makes it difficult to know their actual BP but does not preclude 
  a comparison of methods for the diagnosis of hypertension.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The superior results 
  found refers only to aspects related to a method's sensitivity and accuracy 
  and should not be interpreted as an option to replace one method for another 
  as they are described in the literature as being complementary for diagnosing 
  hypertension.<sup>13</sup> It is not intended here to conclude that one method 
  is superior to another, but rather to point to different methods available that 
  can be used to prevent misdiagnosis. This is supported by the Bland &amp; Altman 
  method results<sup>3</sup> showing that SMBP and AMBP while having a strong 
  correlation did not show good agreement as to suggest that one method should 
  replace the other.<sup>3,5</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While there have 
  been efforts to reduce the patient's anxiety regarding blood pressure measurement, 
  our study found significant BP differences &#134;between the methods tested 
  compared to the gold standard, especially for SBP. SMBP measures were higher 
  than those obtained by the nurse at the medical office (CMBP) and AMBP, showing 
  that although CMBP is less sensitive it remains crucial for the clinical diagnosis 
  of hypertension.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since white coat 
  hypertension, masked hypertension and white coat effect have low prevalence, 
  a test's specificity is the best marker of diagnostic quality. We did not compare 
  a test's superiority because a single test was used to identify different conditions. 
  We found that combining SMBP and CMBP was more effective for the diagnosis of 
  white coat hypertension than masked hypertension and white coat effect.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study results 
  suggest that the anxiety experienced during SMBP can be as important as that 
  due to CMBP. It also showed that when appropriately performed SMBP is a feasible, 
  safe and low-cost approach that can help the clinical diagnosis of hypertension.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In conclusion, 
  SMBP can be used to help the diagnosis when hypertension is suspected but it 
  cannot replace CMBP, which is still the most reliable method. The indiscriminate 
  use of SMBP should be discouraged in the general population because it is only 
  helpful when the protocol is followed consistently but most people do not know 
  the correct procedure. Also, some people may carry out a BP measure at times 
  when they feel their "BP is high," increasing their anxiety. Therefore, the 
  management of hypertension based solely on SMBP is not recommended.</font></p>
