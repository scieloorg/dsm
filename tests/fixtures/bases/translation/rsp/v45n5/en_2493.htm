<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> 
  To evaluate the influence of dietary intake during gestation on postpartum weight 
  retention.<br>
  <b>METHODS:</b> A total of 82 healthy pregnant women who began prenatal care 
  at public healthcare services in the Municipality of S&atilde;o Paulo (Southeastern 
  Brazil) between April and June 2005 were followed up. Weight and height were 
  measured in the first interview (up to 16 weeks of gestation) and the weight 
  measure was repeated during a household visit 15 days after delivery. The 24-Hour 
  Dietary Recall method was employed to evaluate dietary intake at the three trimesters 
  of gestation. The mean ingestion of saturated fat, fibers, added sugar, soft 
  drinks, processed foods, fruits and vegetables, as well as the dietary energy 
  density were calculated. Weight retention was estimated by the difference between 
  the measure of the postpartum weight and the first measured weight. The influence 
  of dietary intake on postpartum weight retention was assessed by multiple linear 
  regression analysis and the linear trend test was performed. The variables used 
  to adjust the model were: body mass index at the beginning of gestation, height, 
  per capita family income, smoking, age, and level of schooling.<br>
  <b>RESULTS:</b> The mean body mass index at the beginning of gestation was 24 
  kg/m<sup>2</sup> and the mean weight retention was 1.9 kg. The increase in saturated 
  fat intake (p=0.005) and processed foods ingestion (p=0.014) significantly increased 
  postpartum weight retention, after adjustment by the control variables. The 
  other dietary intake variables did not present a significant relationship to 
  the outcome variable.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> The increased intake of unhealthy food, such as processed 
  foods, and of saturated fat influences the increment of postpartum weight retention.</font></p>

  Evaluar la influencia de la alimentaci&oacute;n durante la gestaci&oacute;n 
  sobre la retenci&oacute;n de peso post-parto.<br>
  <b>M&Eacute;TODOS:</b> Fueron acompa&ntilde;adas 82 gestantes adultas y saludables 
  que iniciaron el pre-natal en servicio p&uacute;blico de salud en el Municipio 
  de Sao Paulo, Sureste de Brasil, entre abril y junio de 2005. Las medidas de 
  peso y estatura fueron comparadas en la primera entrevista (hasta 16 semanas 
  de gestaci&oacute;n) y la medida de peso fue repetida en visita domiciliar 15 
  d&iacute;as posterior al parto. El Recordatorio de 24 horas fue usado para evaluar 
  el consumo alimentario y fue aplicado en los tres trimestres de la gestaci&oacute;n. 
  Fue calculado el consumo promedio de grasa saturada, fibras, az&uacute;car adicionado, 
  gaseosas, alimentos procesados, frutas, verduras y legumbres y la densidad energ&eacute;tica 
  de la dieta. La retenci&oacute;n de peso fue obtenida por la diferencia entre 
  la medida de peso post-parto y la primera medida realizada. La influencia de 
  la alimentaci&oacute;n sobre la retenci&oacute;n de peso post-parto fue evaluada 
  por medio de an&aacute;lisis de regresi&oacute;n linear m&uacute;ltiple y fue 
  realizada la prueba para tendencia linear. Las variables utilizadas para ajuste 
  del modelo fueron: &iacute;ndice de masa corporal en el inicio de la gestaci&oacute;n, 
  estatura, renta familiar per capita, tabaquismo, edad y escolaridad maternos.<br>
  <b>RESULTADOS:</b> El &iacute;ndice de masa corporal inicial promedio fue de 
  24 kg/m2 y la retenci&oacute;n promedio de peso fue de 1,9 kg. El aumento del 
  consumo de grasa saturada (p=0,005) y alimentos procesados (p=0,014) aumentaron 
  de forma significativa la retenci&oacute;n de peso post-parto, posterior al 
  ajuste por las variables de control. Las dem&aacute;s variables de consumo alimentario 
  no presentaron relaci&oacute;n significativa con la retenci&oacute;n de peso 
  post-parto.<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONES:</b> El mayor consumo de alimentos no saludables, como alimentos 
  procesados, y de grasa saturada influencia el aumento de la retenci&oacute;n 
  de peso post-parto.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the 
  World Health Organization (WHO), inadequate diet and sedentary lifestyle are 
  the two risk factors that most contribute to the increase in the prevalence 
  of overweight and obesity all over the world.<sup>27</sup> Unhealthy dietary 
  habits are present in all the phases of the vital cycle and can affect even 
  more vulnerable population groups, including women in the gestation period. 
  One of the habits that promote excessive weight gain is the high ingestion of 
  sugar-sweetened beverages and foods with high energy density which, in general, 
  are poor in fibers, micronutrients and water, and high in fat, sugar or starch.<sup>26</sup> 
  In addition, the literature reports the association between greater ingestion 
  of foods with high energy density and weight gain in populations of nonpregnant 
  adult women.<sup>3,6,22</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Excessive weight 
  gain during gestation predisposes to postpartum obesity and its complications. 
  Numerous studies show the positive association between excessive weight gain 
  during gestation and weight retention for up to three years after delivery.<sup>8,10,14,16</sup> 
  A study based on data from 50 Demographic Health Surveys conducted in developing 
  countries pointed to the importance of excessive weight gain during gestation 
  and weight retention after delivery as predictors of the increase in overweight 
  prevalence in women of childbearing age, mainly in richer developing countries, 
  such as those of Latin America.<sup>9</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The relationship 
  between higher ingestion of calories and the increase in weight gain during 
  gestation has been demonstrated in the literature since the 1990s.<sup>8</sup> 
  Nowadays, studies aim to relate dietary characteristics and patterns during 
  gestation to weight gain in this period and postpartum weight retention. Studies 
  associate the increased energy density of the diet and a dietary pattern characterized 
  by fast food (candies, chocolates, processed meat, soft drinks, among others) 
  in the gestational period with the increase in weight gain at the end of pregnancy.<sup>5,24</sup> 
  According to Oken et al,<sup>19</sup> unhealthy dietary habits, like higher 
  frequency of snacks and lower number of main dishes (lunch) are associated with 
  higher weight retention up to one year after delivery.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lacerda et al<sup>11</sup> 
  (2007) administered a food frequency questionnaire referring to the gestational 
  period to 467 puerperal women in the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro, Southeastern 
  Brazil, and observed excessive intake of energy and saturated fat during gestation 
  and in the postpartum period.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also in the Municipality 
  of Rio de Janeiro, Rodrigues et al<sup>21</sup> (2008) administered a food frequency 
  questionnaire to 173 women. Gestational weight gain was lower among those who 
  presented adequate energy intake, in accordance with the recommendation of the 
  Food and Agriculture Organization.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Up to the present 
  moment, Brazilian studies that evaluate the influence of the dietary pattern 
  during gestation on postpartum weight retention are not known. Thus, this study 
  aimed to evaluate the influence of dietary intake during gestation on weight 
  retention 15 days after delivery.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is a study 
  nested in a cohort of 225 pregnant women who received prenatal care at five 
  primary care units of the Municipality of S&atilde;o Paulo (Southeastern Brazil). 
  The inclusion criteria were: women older than 18 years, with low-risk pregnancy, 
  and gestational age equal to or below 16 weeks at the moment of the first interview. 
  For the analyses of the present study, pregnant women with no weight information 
  15 days after delivery or with energy intake below 500 kcal or above 5,000 kcal 
  were excluded, so as to withdraw biologically implausible data.<sup>26</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The final sample 
  was constituted of 82 pregnant women, who began to receive prenatal care between 
  April and June 2005. The <a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2493f01.jpg">Figure</a> illustrates 
  the total number of captured and eligible pregnant women and the reasons for 
  the losses. Information on socioeconomic level, lifestyle and obstetric history 
  was obtained during interviews performed during the prenatal consultations. 
  Gestational age was calculated based on the date of the last menstruation informed 
  by the pregnant woman.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Standardized procedures 
  were followed for anthropometric assessment.<sup>15</sup> All the anthropometric 
  measures were calculated twice and their mean was considered for analysis. The 
  weight was measured by Tanita scales with acuity of 200 g and capacity for 150 
  kg. The height was measured by a Seca stadiometer with acuity of 1.0 mm and 
  capacity for 2.0 m.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Weight and height 
  were measured in the first interview. In the other interviews and in the puerperium 
  household visit, the weight measure was repeated. The means of the two weight 
  and height measures calculated in the first prenatal consultation (up to the 
  16<sup>th</sup> week; 72% occurred before the 14<sup>th</sup> week) were used 
  to calculate the body mass index (BMI = weight/height<sup>2</sup>) at the beginning 
  of pregnancy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 24-Hour Dietary 
  Recall method (Rec24h) was employed to evaluate the dietary intake, being administered 
  once in each trimester of gestation, in distinct weekdays, including weekends 
  and holidays. The mean intake of the three measures was used for the analyses. 
  The foods informed in each one of the recalls were converted into energy, fiber 
  and saturated fat according to the nutritional food composition of the Brazilian 
  Food Composition Table.<a name="topa"></a><a href="#backa">ª</a> The ingestion 
  of added sugar (in grams and kilocalories) was calculated based on a specific 
  table of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.<a name="topb"></a><a href="#backb"><sup>b</sup></a> 
  Whenever necessary, the calculation was made based on the recipes and the corresponding 
  correction factor, duly applied.<a name="topc"></a><a href="#backc"><sup>c</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After the calculation 
  of the chemical composition, the foods were classified into the following groups: 
  fruits and vegetables (FV), soft drinks and processed foods. Cookies, salty 
  foods, soft drinks, cold meats and sausages, candies, cakes, bread, pizzas, 
  fast-food sandwiches, broths, sauces and ready-to-eat meals were considered 
  processed foods. Finally, the total dietary energy density (kcal/g) was determined 
  by the division between the total energy intake and the sum of the quantity 
  in grams of all ingested foods (except for liquids).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Postpartum weight 
  retention was evaluated by the net weight gain, that is, the difference between 
  the weight measured in the puerperium visit (performed approximately 15 days 
  after delivery) and the weight measured in the first interview. That measure 
  expresses the total fat accumulated during pregnancy, in view of the fact that 
  at this moment of the postpartum period, the liquid accumulated during pregnancy 
  has already been eliminated.<sup>13</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The total energy 
  intake, the ingested amount (g or kcal) of each food or nutrient and the dietary 
  energy density were considered to characterize the pegnant women's diet, based 
  on the information provided in the three Rec24h. The dietary intake variables 
  were analyzed in continuos form (mean and 95% confidence intervals) and also 
  categorized in thirds. The mean weight retention was calculated by each third 
  of the dietary intake variables: FV, fiber and saturated fat (g); added sugar, 
  soft drinks and processed foods (kcal); and dietary energy density (kcal/g).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Simple and multiple 
  linear regression analyses were carried out separately for each dietary intake 
  variable, with postpartum weight retention as the outcome. The following adjustment 
  variables were used in the regression models: BMI at the beginning of the follow-up, 
  woman's height, <i>per capita</i> family income, level of schooling (completed 
  years of study), age and smoking, categorized as "smokes or stopped smoking 
  during gestation" and "does not smoke or stopped smoking before gestation". 
  The control variables correlated (p&lt;0.20) with the response variable were 
  tested, or the ones that were considered relevant in the study's context. Those 
  which modified by more than 10% the regression coefficient were maintained. 
  The dichotomous variables were categorized as "0" and "1" and the other categorical 
  variables were transformed into dummy variables. To test for linear trend among 
  each third of dietary intake variables, a similar linear regression model was 
  performed, but without the transformation of these variables into dummy variables. 
  A level of significance of 0.05 was adopted in all the statistical tests. The 
  software Stata 9.1 was utilized for the analyses.</font></p>

  was approved by the Ethics Committee of the School of Public Health of <i>Universidade 
  de S&atilde;o Paulo.</i> All the interviewees signed a consent document after

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The studied pregnant 
  women were, on average, 26 years old and their mean BMI at the beginning of 
  pregnancy was 24 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Follow-up started, on average, in the 12<sup>th</sup> 
  week of gestation, and it was the first gestation for approximately half of 
  the women. The majority never smoked or stopped smoking before gestation (87.7%) 
  and lived with their partners (73.2%) (<a href="#t1">Table 1</a>). No statistically 
  significant differences were detected between the studied cohort and loss to 
  follow-up regarding sociodemographic characteristics such as age, level of schooling, 
  parity, income, smoking and presence of partner, and concerning the initial 
  nutritional status (data not shown).</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The mean ingestion 
  of added sugar was approximately 271 kcal. Calories of the processed foods (393.1 
  kcal) represented 20.4% of the total energy intake (TEI). Dietary energy density 
  corresponded to 1.9 kcal/g, and calories obtained from liquid foods were equivalent 
  to approximately 5% of the TEI (<a href="#t2">Table 2</a>).</font></p>
<p><a name="t2"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2493t02.jpg"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The mean weight 
  retention of the studied women was 1.9 kg. In the crude analysis, it was verified 
  that the mean postpartum weight retention increased as the intake of saturated 
  fat, fiber, processed foods and added sugar increased. In the simple linear 
  regression analyses, a statistically significant association was detected between 
  the increased intake of saturated fat (p for trend = 0.006) and of processed 
  foods (p for trend = 0.009) and the increase in weight retention (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2493t03.jpg">Table 
  3</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the multiple 
  linear regression analyses, the linear and positive trend of weight retention 
  remained statistically significant as the intake of saturated fat (p for trend 
  = 0.005) and of processed foods (p for trend = 0.014) increased (<a href="#t4">Table 
  4</a>).</font></p>
<p><a name="t4"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2493t04.jpg"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The outcome variable 
  had normal distribution in the regression analyses. The residuals analysis of 
  the linear regression models indicated that the models are well adjusted (data 
  not shown).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Higher intake of 
  saturated fat and processed foods showed a statistically significant correlation 
  to weight retention 15 days after delivery, independently of family income and 
  maternal level of schooling, height, age and smoking.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The mean weight 
  retention was 1.9 kg, in accordance with the findings of Walker et al (2005),<sup>25</sup> 
  who conducted a literature review and found weight retention values between 
  -0.6 kg and 9.6 kg, in periods that varied from two to six weeks after delivery. 
  According to Walker et al,<sup>25</sup> weight gain during gestation is one 
  of the main predictors of weight retention in a time interval of up to six weeks 
  after delivery. Besides, few studies approach other possible factors related 
  to this outcome.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A cohort study 
  carried out in Sweden between the decades of 1980 and 1990 evaluated the diet 
  of women before, during and after pregnancy by means of a questionnaire with 
  seven questions. The authors of the study concluded that weight retention from 
  one to six months after delivery was higher among women who increased energy 
  intake and the frequency of snacks per day in the gestational period.<sup>18</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A meta-analysis 
  with 19 controlled intervention studies concluded that <i>ad libitum</i> diets 
  low in lipids promoted a reduction of at least 3.2 kg in a period of 2 to 12 
  months.<sup>1</sup> Diets high in fat tend to have higher energy density compared 
  to isocaloric diets with reduced levels of this nutrient. Diets with high energy 
  density, in turn, have been related to weight gain during gestation since the 
  1990s.<sup>8</sup> According to Lagiou et al, the increase in the ingestion 
  of animal fat is related to higher weight gain up to the 27<sup>th</sup> week 
  of gestation, after adjustment by BMI and other lifestyle factors.<sup>12</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Oken et al<sup>19</sup> 
  (2007) found an association between the retention of at least 5 kg one year 
  after delivery with the increased intake of total and trans fat and the reduction 
  in fiber ingestion.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Considering that 
  energy unbalance is part of the mechanism of the dietary influence on weight 
  retention, the model was not adjusted by energy intake, because, by doing this, 
  the effect that is the object of this study is eliminated.<sup>26</sup> Studies 
  confirm that the total caloric ingestion, besides being part of the studied 
  mechanism, is associated with the outcome, excluding the need to adjust it in 
  the model.<sup>2</sup> In fact, the results obtained when adjusting the multiple 
  linear regression models by energy showed that the relations between weight 
  retention and the ingestion of saturated fat and processed foods lost statistical 
  significance (data not shown).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The measurement 
  of dietary intake by Rec24h has advantages over other methods, such as the possibility 
  of characterizing the ingestion of a wide variety of foods, as the instrument 
  is open and any type and amount of food is registered. Persson et al<sup>20</sup> 
  (2001), in a longitudinal assessment of Rec24h with 451 pregnant women, concluded 
  that the utilization of the mean of three Rec24h, administered on different 
  weekdays, allows the characterization of dietary intake, mainly of energy and 
  macronutrients that have lower intra-individual variability. Furthermore, to 
  minimize possible errors, the pregnant women with energy intake considered biologically 
  implausible were excluded from the present study and the dietary intake variables 
  were analyzed in ingestion intervals (thirds).<sup>26</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As for internal 
  validity, the similarities found between the studied women and the loss to follow-up 
  suggest the inexistence of a selection bias of the followed cohort despite the 
  high number of women excluded from the analysis. Cohort studies during gestation 
  conducted in Brazil have reported difficulties in follow-up during the entire 
  gestation period.<sup>17,21</sup> The reduced sample size of the present study 
  limits the capacity to detect associations. However, the assessment of the anthropometric 
  measures and the acquirement of the other information through personally administered 
  questionnaires contribute to the greater reliability of the data obtained in 
  this sample. The power of the test, calculated <i>a posteriori</i>, was higher 
  than 90% for the multiple linear regression models of saturated fat and of processed 
  foods. For the other models, a larger sample would be necessary to detect associations, 
  as the power of the test was not higher than 70%.<sup>4</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Weight retention 
  15 days after delivery directly expresses the accumulation of fat during gestation.<sup>13</sup> 
  The utilization of this outcome is more adequate than weight gain during gestation 
  in studies that aim to evaluate the determinants of the nutritional status at 
  the end of gestation.<sup>14</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The literature 
  reports that there are many determinants of weight retention after delivery<sup>7</sup> 
  and that the maintenance of overweight in puerperium contributes to the increase 
  in the prevalence of overweight and obesity in women, mainly among those with 
  low socioeconomic level.<sup>23</sup> It is necessary to conduct other prospective 
  studies in different populations of pregnant and puerperal women, with larger 
  sample size, to elucidate the influence of the dietary pattern during gestation 
  on postpartum weight retention. Understanding the changes in dietary quality 
  during and after gestation, with methods that analyze the diet as a whole, may 
  contribute to the formulation of efficient interventions in the prevention of 
  women's obesity and other related diseases.</font></p>
