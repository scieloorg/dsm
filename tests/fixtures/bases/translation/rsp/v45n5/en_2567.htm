<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> 
  To analyze the evolution of drug use among treated crack cocaine users.<br>
  <b>METHODS:</b> A cohort originally comprising 131 crack addicts admitted to 
  a detoxification unit in the city of S&atilde;o Paulo, Southeastern Brazil, 
  between 1992 and 1994 were followed up on three occasions: 1995-96, 1998-99, 
  and 2005-06. Variables investigated included demographical data, risky sexual 
  behaviors, intake patterns for crack and other substances, incarceration, disappearance, 
  and death. Statistical analysis was carried out using chi-square tests, multinomial 
  logistic regression and Cox regression.<br>
  <b>RESULTS:</b> Among the patients evaluated, 43 were crack-free (12 months 
  or longer), 22 were users, 13 were imprisoned, two were missing, and 27 were 
  deceased. Three groups with distinct post-discharge drug use patterns were identified. 
  Safe sexual behavior (condom use) was correlated with stable abstinence (p=0.001). 
  Positive HIV test upon admission (p=0.046), use of snorted cocaine in the last 
  year (p=0.001), and lifetime use of snorted cocaine (132 months or longer) (p=0.000) 
  were associated with long term use of crack cocaine. History of intravenous 
  cocaine use increased the probability of death at 12 years by 2.5 fold (p=0.031) 
  (95%CI: 1.08; 5.79).<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> Recurrence and persistence of crack use in the years following 
  discharge reflect new modalities of drug use. On the other hand, stable abstinence 
  patterns provide evidence of the feasibility of recovery from crack addiction.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OBJETIVO:</b> 
  Analizar la evoluci&oacute;n del consumo entre usuarios de crack con historia 
  de tratamiento.<br>
  <b>M&Eacute;TODOS:</b> Una cohorte de, originalmente, 131 dependientes de crack 
  admitidos en una enfermer&iacute;a de desintoxicaci&oacute;n en Sao Paulo, Sureste 
  de Brasil, entre 1992 y 1994, fueron entrevistados nuevamente en tres ocasiones: 
  1995-1996, 1998-1999 y 2005-2006. Las variables investigadas fueron: datos demogr&aacute;ficos, 
  comportamiento sexual de riesgo, patrones de consumo de crack y otras sustancias, 
  prisiones, desaparecimientos y &oacute;bitos. En el an&aacute;lisis estad&iacute;stico 
  se utiliz&oacute; la prueba de chi-cuadrado, la regresi&oacute;n log&iacute;stica 
  mulinomial y regresi&oacute;n de Cox.<br>
  <b>RESULTADOS:</b> De los pacientes evaluados, 43 estaban abstinentes del crack 
  (12 meses o m&aacute;s), 22 eran usuarios, 13 estaban presos, dos desaparecidos 
  y 27 estaban muertos. Se identificaron tres grupos con trayectorias distintas 
  de consumo post-alta. Comportamiento seguro con uso de preservativo fue identificado 
  como factor relacionado al grupo de abstinentes estables (p=0,001). Prueba VIH 
  positiva en la internaci&oacute;n (p=0,046); consumo de coca&iacute;na aspirada 
  en el &uacute;ltimo a&ntilde;o (p=0,001) y tiempo de uso de coca&iacute;na aspirada 
  en la vida (m&aacute;s de 132 meses) (p=0,000) fueron factores relacionados 
  al uso por largo tiempo. Uso previo de coca&iacute;na endovenosa aument&oacute; 
  en 2,5 veces las chances de &oacute;bito en 12 a&ntilde;os (p=0,031) (IC95%:1,08;5,79).<br>
  <b>CONCLUSIONES:</b> La recurrencia y persistencia de consumo en los a&ntilde;os 
  post-alta de tratamiento reflejan nuevas modalidades de uso de crack. Por otro 
  lado, patrones de abstinencia estable apuntan la viabilidad de los procesos 
  de recuperaci&oacute;n relativos al uso de crack.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Longitudinal studies 
  of trends in substance abuse are an essential tool for planning public health 
  interventions. Notwithstanding, long-term follow-up studies of the consequences 
  of crack cocaine use are still scarce.<sup>3,7</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A topic of interest 
  in recent years has been the longevity of crack cocaine use among treated and 
  nontreated users, especially given its intensity, recurrence, and, in many cases, 
  persistence.<sup>13</sup> These studies indicate that the use of crack cocaine 
  is no longer an essentially short-term practice. Such a pattern raises the need 
  for methodological and conceptual tools that allow for a better understanding 
  of the complexity and evolution of phenomena related to crack cocaine use.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The documentation 
  of different drug use trajectories<sup>24</sup> allows us to characterize heterogeneous 
  groups, as well as to define groups that are more vulnerable to health-related 
  disorders and factors that are associated with stable abstinence.<sup>14</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The aim of the 
  present study was to investigate the evolution of crack cocaine use among treated 
  users.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We carried out 
  a prospective study within a larger research project following a cohort of 131 
  crack cocaine users admitted to a detoxification unit in a general hospital 
  in the North region of the city of Sao Paulo, Southeastern Brazil. Subjects 
  were followed up two (1995-96), five (1998-99), and twelve (2005-06) years after 
  discharge.<sup>6,15,21</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This convenience 
  sample was obtained from the admissions registry of the detoxification unit, 
  and included patients consecutively admitted between May 1992 and December 1994. 
  The criterion for inclusion was addiction to crack cocaine, diagnosed according 
  to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition 
  (DSM-IV). Diagnosis was established during a clinical interview with the team 
  of psychiatrists responsible for admissions at the time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We chose a study 
  design that allowed us to follow a cohort of subjects for a long time so as 
  to identify potential outcomes, such as death, disappearance, imprisonment (information 
  obtained from relatives), and intake of or abstinence from crack cocaine (usage 
  patterns in the last 12 years).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The hospital we 
  investigated pioneered the specialized treatment of crack cocaine addiction 
  within the public health care network in Sao Paulo in the early 1990s, at the 
  onset of the crack cocaine epidemic in the city. Admissions were scrutinized 
  by an interdisciplinary team (comprising psychiatrists, a psychologist, nurses, 
  a social worker, and an occupational therapist), and lasted for two to three 
  weeks.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Data were obtained 
  from patient charts filled out at the time of admission and from in-person interviews 
  using structured questionnaires.<sup>22</sup> The information obtained from 
  patient charts included demographics, HIV/AIDS (tested upon admission), history 
  of usage and prior admissions, intravenous drug use, and family history of chemical 
  addiction. During the interviews, we investigated the following indicators: 
  employment situation, schooling, risky sexual behavior, imprisonment, disappearance, 
  death, occurrence and usage patterns for multiple substances (legal and illegal), 
  lifetime use of crack cocaine and other substances, change of route of cocaine 
  administration, peak period of crack cocaine use, and crack cocaine use trajectory 
  (change in patterns throughout the 12-year period).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Intake data were 
  self-reported. We considered use as sporadic when occurring up to two times 
  per week; frequent when occurring three to four times a week; and heavy when 
  occurring five to seven times a week.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The interviewer 
  for the third follow-up was the same person that conducted the prior evaluations 
  and was therefore known to the subjects. To improve the quality of these encounters, 
  questionnaires were administered during home visits.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We confirmed the 
  data on mortality and imprisonment by consulting official government records 
  (State Data Analysis System Foundation &#91;<i>Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o Sistema 
  Estadual de An&aacute;lise de Dados</i>&#93; and Program for the Improvement 
  of Mortality Information &#91;<i>Programa de Aprimoramento das Informa&ccedil;&otilde;es 
  de Mortalidade</i>&#93;).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For statistical 
  analysis, the characteristics of the sample were described using simple frequencies 
  and percentages. For quantitative variables, we calculated mean and standard 
  deviation. To compare categorical variables, we used the chi-squared and Fisher's 
  exact tests, with a significance threshold of 5%. For contingency tables larger 
  than 2x2 and in which there was evidence of statistical association (p&lt;0.05), 
  we used residual analysis to identify categories that were different within 
  the groups (standardized residuals &gt; 1.96).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mortality evaluation 
  was carried out in two steps. In univariate analysis, stratified survival curves 
  were tested and compared using the log-rank test, taking into account variables 
  collected during admission for treatment. Three of these variables showed significant 
  associations (p&lt;0.10) and were tested using Cox regression including variables 
  that could independently lead to increased risk of death. For the significant 
  variable in the final model, we calculated relative risk and 95% confidence 
  interval.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Using multinomial 
  logistic regression (with stepwise forward inclusion), none of the variables 
  in the admission chart remained as a predictive factor of stable abstinence 
  or persistent intake.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Analyses were carried 
  out using SPSS for Windows, version 13.0.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All procedures 
  were approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Universidade Federal de 
  S&atilde;o Paulo (Process no.1420/05).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RESULTS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Twelve years after 
  discharge, we were able to trace 107 (81.6%) of the 131 subjects in the initial 
  sample. Of these, which 27 (20.6%) had died, two (1.5%) were missing, and 13 
  (10%) were imprisoned. The other 65 subjects (49.6%) were distributed among 
  abstinent subjects and regular users of crack cocaine (for 12 months or more), 
  with 43 (32.8%) and 22 (16.8%) subjects in each group, respectively.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 24 subjects 
  (18.3%) lost to follow-up could not be located by the researchers due to successive 
  changes in address. Of these, two were evaluated only in the first follow-up 
  (1995-96), seven only in the second (1998-99), 12 were interviewed in both follow-ups, 
  and three could never be traced. There were no statistically significant differences 
  between traced subjects and losses in terms of admission variables such as demographics, 
  history of use of crack cocaine and other substances, prior treatment, legal 
  problems, and HIV seroprevalence.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of the 27 deaths 
  (20.6% of subjects), 59% were violent (homicides). The second most frequent 
  cause of death was AIDS (22%) (<a href="#t1">Table 1</a>).</font></p>
<p><a name="t1"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2567t01.jpg"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of the variables 
  recorded during admission, three were related to decreased probability of survival: 
  years of schooling (p=0.044); prior use of intravenous cocaine (p=0.002); and 
  positive HIV status (p=0.000). According to the Cox regression model, prior 
  use of intravenous cocaine increased by 2.5 fold the risk of death in 12 years 
  (p-0.031) (95%CI: 1.08; 5.79) (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2567f01.jpg">Figure</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the 12 year 
  period, abstinent subjects and crack cocaine users were divided in terms of 
  marital status, with 43% being single and 37%, married. Mean age was 35 years, 
  with 49% of subjects aged between 31 and 38 years. Only 15% of subjects were 
  unemployed. Almost one-half of subjects (49.2%) did not study beyond elementary 
  schooling, and 77% did not attend school in the year preceding the interview.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regarding use of 
  legal and illegal drugs in the year preceding the interview, the wide majority 
  of subjects (n=45; 74%) reported sporadic alcohol consumption. Of these, 28 
  were abstinent from crack cocaine, and 17 were users. The same percentages were 
  found for heavy tobacco use (n=45; 74%), also divided among abstinent subjects 
  (n=28) and crack cocaine users (n=17). Most subjects did not use marijuana in 
  the preceding year (n=42; 69%), divided into 31 abstinent subjects and 11 crack 
  cocaine users. Among marijuana users, 39% showed sporadic use and 33%, intensive 
  use. There was no significant difference between crack cocaine users and abstinent 
  subjects in terms of use of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana in the year preceding 
  the interview (<a href="#t2">Table 2</a>).</font></p>
<p><a name="t2"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2567t02.jpg"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More than half 
  the subjects (n=40; 64.5%) reported no use of snorted cocaine in the year preceding 
  the interview. Among subjects who used snorted cocaine during this period, 68% 
  reported frequent to heavy use. Former crack cocaine users (n=34) differed significantly 
  from current crack cocaine users (n=6) with respect to abstinence from snorted 
  cocaine use (p=0.000).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Use of the remaining 
  substances - including amphetamines, hallucinogens, opioids, and intravenous 
  cocaine - in the last year was not reported by any of the subjects.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The mean age of 
  onset of snorted cocaine use was 18 years. Mean age of onset of crack cocaine 
  use was 22 years, with no significant differences between users and abstinent 
  subjects for both snorted and crack cocaine. There was a four-year interval 
  between the onset of snorted cocaine and crack cocaine use.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mean lifetime use 
  of snorted cocaine and crack were 11 years, six months (140 months; SD=78.4) 
  and eight years, ten months (106 months; SD=65.47), respectively. There was, 
  therefore, a long-term simultaneous use of snorted and crack cocaine. Lifetime 
  use of snorted cocaine ranged from frequent to heavy for 53% of subjects and 
  use of crack cocaine was heavy for 74% of subjects.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regarding the migration 
  of routes of administration, snorted cocaine remained as the primary route employed 
  by 88.5% (n=54) of subjects. The smoked route (crack) was the initial route 
  of 9.8% (n=6) of subjects, and only 1.6% (n=1) began to use cocaine by the intravenous 
  route.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Smoking (crack 
  cocaine) remained as the second route of cocaine administration in 82% of subjects; 
  only 12% used intravenous administration as their second route, and 7%, snorted 
  cocaine. There was no transition to a third route in almost all subjects (81.5%). 
  The alleged reason for moving from the first (snorted) to the second (crack) 
  route was preference for the intensity of the effect (51%).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Approximately 12 
  months after the first use, users reached "binge" crack cocaine intake, with 
  an individual average of 50 rocks (SD=5.3) in four consecutive days (SD=1.86).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Based on the information 
  on the oscillation of use and/or on the periods of drug use and abstinence among 
  subjects (diversity of usage patterns), we were able to discern three groups 
  with distinct post-discharge usage patterns; (group 1; n=31) stable abstinent 
  subjects: subjects reporting abstinence for at least five consecutive years; 
  (group 2; n=20) intermediate: subjects alternating between periods of use and 
  abstinence; and (group 3; n=14) prolonged users: subjects who sustained crack 
  cocaine use throughout the 12-year period (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2567t03.jpg">Table 
  3</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Factors associated 
  with sustained crack cocaine use in the 12-year follow-up period (group 3) included 
  positive HIV test at admission (p=0.046); use of snorted cocaine in the previous 
  year (p=0.001); and lifetime use of snorted cocaine &gt; 132 months (p=0.000).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The only variable 
  to differ significantly between stable abstinent subjects (group 1) (67.7% abstinent 
  for five to ten consecutive years) and the intermediate (group 2) and prolonged 
  use (group 3) groups was safe sexual behavior with condom use (p=0.001) (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2567t04.jpg">Table 
  4</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Age of onset of 
  alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use was distributed as follows: alcohol, 15 
  years (range = 5-34 years); tobacco, 15.5 years (range 10-32 years); and marijuana, 
  16 years (range 11-36 years). There was no statistically significant difference 
  between abstinent subjects and crack cocaine users in terms of age of onset 
  of these other substances (p=0.773, p=0.930, p=0.705, respectively).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lifetime duration 
  of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use were 19 (SD=6.6), 18 (SD=6.5), and 12 
  (SD=7) years, respectively, with no statistically significant differences between 
  crack cocaine users and abstinent subjects. Lifetime use of marijuana was sporadic 
  for 47% of users, and use of alcohol was frequent for 75% of users. Lifetime 
  use of tobacco was heavy for 95% of users.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present study 
  describes the evolution of crack cocaine use in a cohort of treated users. This 
  evolution is characterized by a high rate of mortality for violent causes, migration 
  of administration routes, and lifetime use of legal (alcohol, tobacco) and illegal 
  (marijuana, cocaine) substances. Periods of heavier consumption (50 rocks in 
  four days) confirm the presence of "binge" patterns in this cohort. We were 
  also able to define three groups with distinct consumption trajectories and 
  their associated factors.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Use of other substances 
  in addition to crack cocaine is frequent among users.<sup>3,10</sup> In the 
  present study, reported use of other substances, both ever in life and in the 
  previous year, confirmed this tendency, even though we were unable to clearly 
  establish how these associations operate or their meaning.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is estimated 
  that subjects who seek treatment for cocaine use (in general) show high frequency 
  of alcohol abuse.<sup>7,1120</sup> The combination of snorted cocaine and alcohol 
  or crack cocaine and alcohol can be very different: while in the former case, 
  alcohol generally tends to reinforce the positive effects of snorted cocaine, 
  in the latter case, alcohol use takes place after crack cocaine use, as an attempt 
  to "wet" the dryness of the mouth, "rebound" the intensity of the effects of 
  crack cocaine, and/or counteract undesirable effects. Moreover, in late stages, 
  alcohol tends to reduce the dose of crack cocaine used.<sup>10</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our analysis of 
  lifetime use of snorted or crack cocaine showed that transition from the snorted 
  form of the drug, more common at the onset of cocaine use,<sup>11</sup> to the 
  smoked form did not necessarily lead to forfeiting of the initial route. When 
  this was the case, we observed concomitant use of snorted and crack cocaine 
  for a period of many years, especially among patients in group 3 (prolonged 
  use). According to Guindalini et al<sup>11</sup> (2006), the combination of 
  the two routes would characterize a distinct class ("dual" users), associated 
  with greater occurrence of legal problems and greater risk to health. On the 
  other hand, there is doubt as to the role played by snorted cocaine in the long-term 
  maintenance of crack cocaine use. Such a correlation was detected, but not elucidated, 
  in the present study. We do not know whether dependency was aggravated by the 
  combination of the two substances, and therefore whether there was greater difficulty 
  in interrupting the use and/or decreased consumption of crack secondary to snorted 
  cocaine use (either in alternation or as a substitute), allowing the user to 
  "stretch" crack cocaine use in the long term.<sup>7</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The use of crack 
  cocaine can follow a number of distinct trajectories, and its duration can vary 
  from brief to prolonged periods.<sup>12</sup> In the present study, we detected 
  prolonged cycles of use (group 2) and uninterrupted use of crack cocaine for 
  many years (group 3 and lifetime use).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the international 
  literature, Falck et al<sup>8</sup> (2007) evaluated a cohort of 430 crack cocaine 
  users, mostly males, over 18 years of age, with fixed residence and no pending 
  criminal charges. The authors reported that, after an eight-year follow-up, 
  63% of subjects were still using the drug, indicating the viability of extended 
  crack cocaine use for decades.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Brazil, long 
  term crack cocaine use tends to be stimulated by high availability (or profitability) 
  and ease of access. Moreover, the formulation of the drug has undergone changes 
  (in color, consistency, effect, and size), which resulted in "impure" preparations 
  (lower addictive potential, greater addition of diluents).<sup>19</sup> Another 
  aspect that plays a role in the longevity of crack cocaine use is the development 
  of individual strategies for maintaining extended consumption patterns, albeit 
  at lower intensity levels. Although heavy use is still the norm rather than 
  the exception,<sup>7</sup> there are studies (still incipient) that report moderate 
  patterns of crack cocaine consumption<sup>9</sup> and its conciliation with 
  daily activities.<a name="topa"></a><a href="#backa">ª</a> Oliveira &amp; Nappo<sup>18</sup> 
  (2008) detected a trend among individuals that transitioned from compulsive 
  patterns to more controlled use. According to these authors, the subjects themselves 
  devised strategies for self-regulation such as, for instance, distancing themselves 
  from the environment in which they used the drug, structuring daily and leisure 
  activities, moderating the use of other "trigger" substances, or administering 
  other drugs as substitutes for crack cocaine. Self-regulatory practices appear 
  to indicate a dynamic process in which the user tests and accumulates experiences 
  with regard to forms of use and their associated damage, relying on procedures 
  aimed at reducing risks and actively building a culture of drug use.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A factor that was 
  strongly correlated with long-term crack cocaine use was positive HIV testing 
  upon admission. Maintenance of drug use by seropositive individuals raises the 
  need for damage control strategies (consistent condom use, distribution of pipes, 
  holders, and lip protectors) aimed at preventing HIV transmission and reinfection 
  as well as other STDs (such as syphilis and gonorrhea). Crack cocaine abuse 
  has been implicated not only as a risk factor for HIV infection, but also as 
  a potential "catalyst" of disease progression among seropositive users.<sup>1,4</sup> 
  Combined interventions (effect maximization) are recommended as a treatment 
  for both problems. Regarding HIV, it is recommended that users be referred to 
  testing and follow-up facilities and undergo constant monitoring of their adherence 
  to antiretroviral treatment and of their motivation to care for their health 
  and body.<sup>2</sup> With the exception of a positive correlation with safe 
  sexual behavior (condom use), we were unable to identify other factors associated 
  with stability of abstinence trajectories. Notwithstanding, the composition 
  of a group of long-abstinent subjects (group 1) indicated the rupture of skepticism 
  with respect to the impossibility of overcoming crack cocaine addiction and 
  sustaining abstinence for an extended period.<sup>16</sup> In an attempt to 
  understand the recovery process, studies in the literature seek to uncover indicators 
  closely related to stable abstinence.<sup>13,17</sup> These include the study 
  by Siegal et al<sup>24</sup> (2002), which showed a strong correlation between 
  stable abstinence and prolonged detoxification treatment.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regarding the cohort 
  in the present study, effective forfeiting of crack cocaine use was seen to 
  occur anywhere from early in treatment to much later in the process. Stable 
  abstinence among treated crack users may establish itself both in the short 
  term and after several years of treatment. A study conducted in the United States 
  with a cohort of 1,271 drug users (64% of which used cocaine) estimated that 
  the mean lag between onset of treatment and the last episode of drug use was 
  nine years.<sup>5</sup> Scott et al<sup>23</sup> (2005) reported a range of 
  three to four treatment episodes spread across a long time period before stable 
  abstinence patterns were achieved. The expectation of early interruption of 
  crack use (high expectation), in addition to promoting the divestment of care 
  when unsuccessful, also compromises the trajectory of change, which might take 
  years to occur.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Future investigations 
  should attempt to elucidate the so-called "turning points," which are significant 
  events in the life of users that tend to favor the interruption of crack cocaine 
  intake. It will also be important to detect the moments in the life of individuals 
  in which other mechanisms (related to health and social/cultural life) external 
  to formal treatment play a supporting role in altering their exclusive relationship 
  with the drug.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Limitations of 
  the present study include the fact that our sample was obtained from a single 
  treatment institution, the small proportion of women in our sample, and the 
  absence of physical measurement of drug use. Other phenomena that are relevant 
  to this field of study were not explored, such as pipe or holder sharing, combined 
  use of crack and tobacco or crack and marijuana, and occurrence of tuberculosis 
  and hepatitis.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The design of the 
  current study did not allow us to conduct an in-depth analysis of issues related 
  to the motivation of subjects to seek formal treatment. Neither could we investigate 
  the consequences of treatment to the users' lives, including its potential contribution 
  to stable abstinence. Furthermore, the factors involved in prolonged crack cocaine 
  use could not be explored, likely because the measurements we made were not 
  appropriate for detecting positive correlations that would allow us to explore 
  these factors. If this is the case, a qualitative approach would be useful to 
  help elucidate these aspects in depth, providing consistent indicators and goals 
  to aid in the planning of drug-user care initiatives.</font></p>
