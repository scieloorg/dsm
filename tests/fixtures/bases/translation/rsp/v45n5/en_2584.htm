<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This paper aimed 
  to analyze the fluoride concentration in drinking water, taking into account 
  the balance between the benefits and risks to health, in order to produce scientific 
  backing for the updating of the Brazilian legislation. Systematic reviews studies, 
  official documents and meteorological data were examined. The temperatures in 
  Brazilian state capitals indicate that fluoride levels should be between 0.6 
  and 0.9 mg F/l in order to prevent dental caries. Natural fluoride concentration 
  of 1.5 mg F/l is tolerated for consumption in Brazil if there is no technology 
  with an acceptable cost-benefit ratio for adjusting/removing the excess. Daily 
  intake of water with a fluoride concentration &gt; 0.9 mg F/l presents a risk 
  to the dentition among children under the age of eight years, and consumers 
  should be explicitly informed of this risk. In view of the expansion of the 
  Brazilian water fluoridation program to regions with a typically tropical climate, 
  Ordinance 635/75 relating to fluoride added to the public water supply should 
  be revised.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Water is a public 
  asset that is indispensable for life. Its importance for public health is widely 
  recognized, but more than one billion people worldwide do not have access to 
  treated water. Among these people, 19 million live in Brazil.<sup>26</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Observational studies 
  in the United States in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century revealed 
  an inverse correlation between the fluoride content in the water supply and 
  the mean number of decayed teeth among the population. However, it was found 
  that above a certain concentration, the occurrence of caries ceased to significantly 
  diminish, while the prevalence of dental fluorosis increased significantly. 
  This series of studies was essential for estimating the optimum fluoride level 
  that would provide the maximum benefit of reduction in caries with the minimum 
  risk of dental fluorosis and for consequently adopting water fluoridation as 
  a public health measure.<sup>3</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fluoridation of 
  the water in treatment plants has been obligatory in Brazil since 1974, as set 
  forth in Federal Law 6050.<a name="topa"></a><a href="#backa">ª</a> In 1975, 
  Ordinance 635 established standards for implementing this measure,<a name="topb"></a><a href="#backb"><sup>b</sup></a> 
  which included the recommended limits for fluoride concentration as a ratio 
  of the mean maximum daily temperature. Since then, the coverage of water fluoridation 
  has increased, and it reached approximately half of the country's population 
  in the first decade of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Water fluoridation has been 
  supported not only through resolutions approved at health and oral health conferences 
  but also by the Brazilian Ministry of Health and by the main professional entities 
  in Brazil within the fields of dentistry and public health.<sup>21</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1988, fluoride 
  was added to a brand of toothpaste widely used in Brazil, and by 1989, more 
  than 90% of the products available to consumers were fluoridated.<sup>8</sup> 
  The use of fluoride in the water and in toothpaste has been responsible for 
  a significant decline in the levels of dental caries among children and adolescents 
  in Brazil and has been heralded as an important change that may confer a different 
  oral health pattern from that of the present for the coming generations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two years after 
  the approval of the federal law relating to fluoridation, the Ministry of Health 
  approved drinking water standards and criteria through Ordinance 56/1977.<a name="topc"></a><a href="#backc"><sup>c</sup></a> 
  Given the presence of both added and naturally occurring fluoride in water for 
  human consumption, 1.7 mg F/l was set as the maximum permitted amount. This 
  concentration was subsequently changed in 2000,<a href="#backd"><sup>d</sup></a> 
  with the publication of Ordinance 1469, which defined 1.5 mg F/l as the maximum 
  permitted amount. This guidance was maintained in Ordinance 518.<a name="tope"></a><a href="#backe"><sup>e</sup></a> 
  In 2009, the Ministry of Health instituted a working group with the aim of reviewing 
  this ordinance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fluoride concentration 
  is an important parameter for the quality assessment of drinking water because 
  of its ability to prevent caries when fluoride is present at appropriate levels, 
  and for its potential to provoke dental fluorosis when present at high levels. 
  The establishment of safety levels for fluoride in drinking water is an essential 
  measure for protecting human health.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The aim of this 
  review was to analyze the potability of drinking water with regard to fluoride 
  levels within the Brazilian context, while taking into consideration the balance 
  between benefits and risks to health. In addition, supporting data were produced 
  with consideration to revision of the national legislation.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODOLOGICAL 
  PROCEDURES</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To select the material 
  for analysis, we consulted the database of the University of York Centre for 
  Reviews and Dissemination, part of the National Institute for Health Research 
  of the United Kingdom, which provides backing for decision makers. This database 
  is updated daily and, among other information, includes studies indexed in PubMed/MEDLINE 
  and those produced by important systematic review centers. The term "fluoride" 
  was searched. Systematic reviews on the benefits and risks of fluoridated water 
  for dentition and for bone health published between the years 2000 and 2009 
  were included. From this search, 77 systematic review studies were found, of 
  which five covered the questions of interest. Two of them had the aim of investigating 
  possible adverse effects.<sup>18,31</sup> The other three dealt with the effects 
  of fluoride on bone health.<sup>13,10,33</sup> In addition, a systematic review 
  commissioned by the Australian government on the efficacy and safety of water 
  fluoridation was included.<a href="#backf"><sup>f</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To determine the 
  optimum fluoride levels in the Brazilian Federal District and state capitals, 
  latitude, longitude, altitude and 2008 temperature data were obtained from the 
  National Institute of Meteorology.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, the 
  electronic sites of government agencies and official documents relating to this 
  topic were consulted.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The results from 
  the analysis focused on three issues: the benefits of fluoride in the water, 
  its risks and the standards adopted in different countries.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>BENEFITS OF 
  FLUORIDE IN THE WATER</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over the last decades 
  of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, declines in tooth decay among child populations 
  were described in several developed countries. The expansion of fluoride use 
  was taken to be the most important cause of this epidemiological event, which 
  was unprecedented.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was believed 
  that the main preventive effect came from fluoride intake during the formation 
  of tooth enamel, which became more resistant to decay. Today, it is known that 
  the anti-caries effect of fluoride depends essentially on having it constantly 
  present in the oral environment (saliva, dental bacterial plaque and enamel 
  surface). This presence can be ensured both through systemic use of fluoride 
  (in water and cooking salt) and through topical use (toothpaste, mouth rinses, 
  gels and varnish).<sup>9</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fluoride is widely 
  used as a public health measure worldwide. In some countries, widespread use 
  of fluoridated toothpaste is the only population-based strategy for preventing 
  caries. Nonetheless, selecting the best option for ensuring access to fluoride 
  in public health strategy terms depends on the prevalence and distribution of 
  dental caries along with mobility, educational attainment, economic level and 
  acceptability among the population.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The use of fluoride 
  as a preventive and therapeutic measure for caries began in 1945 and 1946 in 
  the US and Canada with four pioneering studies that had the main aim of investigating 
  the effectiveness of this measure.<sup>3</sup> In 1951, water fluoridation became 
  an official policy in the US. In 1960, approximately 50 million people in the 
  US were benefiting from this measure, and by 2006, it had reached nearly 60% 
  of the population of that country. This measure has been considered to be one 
  of ten most important public health achievements of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.<sup>5</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the United Kingdom, 
  the implementation of this measure began in 1960.<sup>1</sup> In New Zealand, 
  approximately 65% of the population had received the benefit by 1968.<sup>23</sup> 
  In the Republic of Ireland, by 1996, 66% of the population benefited from this 
  measure.<sup>23</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The fluoridation 
  of drinking water has been recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), 
  among other important worldwide entities within the field of healthcare. In 
  1986, at an international conference on "Appropriate Use of Fluorides," water 
  fluoridation was highlighted as an effective, safe and cheap intervention that 
  should be implemented and maintained wherever it is possible.<sup>35</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Brazil, fluoridation 
  in treating the water supply began in 1953 in the municipality of Baixo Guandu. 
  Comparisons of caries rates among schoolchildren aged 6 to 14 years between 
  1953 and 1963 showed results similar to those observed in the US and Canada. 
  A study conducted in Barretos, Southern Brazil, on a similar population, confirmed 
  the findings from Baixo Guandu.<sup>25</sup> After the federal law on fluoridation 
  was enacted, use of this measure expanded enormously in the 1980s. By 2006, 
  the benefits of fluoridation had reached approximately 100 million people. Brazil 
  presented a notable reduction in caries experience between 1986 and 2003. The 
  caries rate - mean DMFT - at 12 years of age went down from 6.7 to 2.8 affected 
  teeth.<sup>22</sup> Data from 2003 showed that children and adolescents living 
  in cities with water fluoridation exhibited caries levels approximately one 
  third lower than those living in cities without this benefit.<a name="topg"></a><a href="#backg"><sup>g</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among nearly 60 
  countries that adopted water fluoridation as a method for preventing and controlling 
  dental caries, the following countries with the highest coverage can be highlighted: 
  Hong Kong (100%), Singapore (100%), Israel (75%), Colombia (70%), Malaysia (approximately 
  70%), Ireland (66%), Australia (61%), US (61%), New Zealand (61%), Brunei (56%), 
  Brazil (approximately 50%), Canada (43%) and Chile (40%). At the start of the 
  21<sup>st</sup> century, fluoridation was benefiting approximately 400 million 
  people.<sup>1</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the reviews 
  consulted<sup>18</sup> included two prospective cohort studies, one retrospective 
  cohort study and 23 others that compared caries rates before and after water 
  fluoridation. The results from the studies indicated that water fluoridation 
  was effective in preventing caries and was statistically associated with i) 
  a lower proportion of children with tooth decay, with the median of the mean 
  difference in proportions at 14.6% and ii) lower numbers of teeth that were 
  decayed, missing and filled because of caries, equivalent to 40% prevention 
  of new caries. The effect of the water fluoridation was evident, even if it 
  is assumed that other sources of fluoride use were present, such as fluoridated 
  toothpaste. Moreover, if fluoridation was halted, the differences in caries 
  outcomes between regions with and without fluoridation became smaller.<sup>18</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A review published 
  in the US<sup>31</sup> included eight cross-sectional studies, one non-randomized 
  clinical trial, eight prospective studies and one time series study. The results 
  indicated i) a mean reduction of between 30% and 50% in the caries experience 
  among individuals living in regions with fluoridated water, as compared with 
  people living in regions without this measure and ii) that halting of fluoridation 
  gave rise to a 17.9% increase in the experience of caries.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Australian 
  review<a href="#backf"><sup>f</sup></a> took into consideration the previous 
  published papers and added one study conducted in Finland.<sup>28</sup> However, 
  inclusion of this study did not modify the conclusions regarding the reduction 
  in caries prevalence resulting from water fluoridation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Based on these 
  data, it can be concluded that water fluoridation is an effective measure for 
  preventing and controlling dental caries in children and adolescents.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>RISKS OF FLUORIDE 
  IN THE WATER</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the reviews 
  consulted assessed the negative effects of water fluoridation that have been 
  documented in the scientific literature.<sup>18</sup> The main association found 
  at levels of less than 4.0 mg F/l was with dental fluorosis. This is a disorder 
  of enamel development that occurs during tooth formation and is characterized 
  by hypomineralization and greater porosity of the region immediately below the 
  surface of the tooth enamel. At fluoride concentrations of more than 1.0 mg/l 
  in the water supply, opaque areas start to become visible on the enamel surface.<sup>27</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These opacities 
  are symmetrical because the teeth formed at the same time have the same abnormality. 
  Nonetheless, enamel opacities of non-fluorotic origin that can be manifested 
  symmetrically also exist.<sup>7</sup> While non-fluorotic opacities are rounded 
  and delimited (<a href="#f1">Figure 1</a>), fluorotic opacities are diffused 
  and transversed (<a href="#f2">Figure 2</a>).</font></p>
<p><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2584f01.jpg"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2584f02.jpg"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The effect of fluoride 
  on tooth enamel is dose-dependent. In other words, whenever there is fluoride 
  intake during enamel formation, there will be a certain level of fluorosis. 
  However, the clinical significance of fluorosis provoked will depend on the 
  various sources to which individuals are exposed and the time for which this 
  exposure lasts.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the fluoride 
  dose to which children are exposed increases, the opacities become ever more 
  visible, which may characterize a more severe degree of dental fluorosis. <a href="#f3">Figure 
  3</a> presents a case of severe fluorosis caused by well water containing 3.6 
  mg F/l, i.e., an amount five times greater than the optimum concentration level 
  for the Brazilian climate.</font></p>
<p><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2584f03.jpg"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The critical period 
  for exposure to excessive doses of fluoride to the two dentitions is from birth 
  up to the age of 8 years.<sup>17</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Given the expected 
  effects from water fluoridation and in the light of the high prevalence rates 
  and severity of dental caries in the 1950s, esthetically acceptable related 
  dental fluorosis resulting from water fluoridation was considered to be the 
  price to be paid for the benefit of caries prevention.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, it was 
  recognized that this value could vary according to the daily intake of water. 
  Subsequently, it was shown that children living in hotter regions had less caries 
  and more fluorosis compared to children living in colder regions with the same 
  fluoride level in the drinking water.<sup>12</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For this reason, 
  a method for determining the optimum fluoride level in the water supply, taking 
  into consideration the effect of mean maximum daily temperatures on the water 
  consumed by children, was formulated. Thus, a range of optimum fluoride concentrations 
  (0.7 to 1.2 mg F/l) was established according to the temperature in different 
  regions of the US (<a href="#f4">Figure 4</a>), which ranged from 10.9 &#176;C 
  (51.7 &#176;F) to 29.6 &#176;C (85.3 &#176;F).<sup>12</sup> Thus, the specific 
  optimum fluoride level for each region came to be defined through a mathematical 
  formula that took into account fluid intake and the ambient temperature.</font></p>
<p><a name="f4"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2584f04.jpg"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Adverse dental 
  effects caused by prolonged intake of high levels of naturally occurring fluoride 
  in the water are also known in Brazil. Tooth enamel defects in schoolchildren 
  exposed to high levels of fluoride have been documented in Pereira Barreto, 
  Southeastern Brazil, and in Cocal do Sul, Southern Brazil.<sup>4,32</sup> Through 
  prohibiting the use of these water sources, the multiple cases of fluorosis 
  found ceased to occur.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Only some of the 
  cases of dental fluorosis presented esthetic problems. McDonagh et al.<sup>18</sup> 
  reviewed 88 studies that met the inclusion criteria and separated the effects 
  resulting from any degree of dental fluorosis from the effects associated with 
  fluorosis of esthetic significance. The prevalence of fluorosis of esthetic 
  significance was estimated to be 10.0% (95% CI: 5.0; 17.9) and 12.5% (95% CI: 
  7.0; 21.5) for 0.7 and 1.0 mg F/l, respectively. Regression analyses showed 
  a strong association between the fluoride level and the proportion of the population 
  with any degree of fluorosis. The effect of exposure to different concentrations 
  of fluoride in the water compared with areas of up to 0.4 mg F/l was estimated, 
  and a difference of 15% (95% CI: 4.1; 27.2) was found in areas with 1.0 mg F/l, 
  and a difference of 18.9% (95% CI: 7.2; 30.6) was found in areas with 1.2 mg 
  F/l.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It can be concluded 
  that the proportion of fluorosis levels of esthetic significance in children 
  and adolescents diminishes as the fluoride concentration in the water comes 
  closer to the range of 0.5 to 0.7 mg F/l. This trend corresponds to a greater 
  proportion of fluorosis without esthetic impairment and signifies a safe level 
  of fluoride, either in water containing naturally occurring fluoride or in artificially 
  fluoridated water (<a href="#f5">Figure 5</a>).</font></p>
<p><a name="f5"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2584f05.jpg"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A review of the 
  literature on esthetic perceptions and dental fluorosis showed that very mild 
  and mild degrees of dental fluorosis did not produce any negative impact on 
  quality of life among the populations investigated.<sup>6</sup> In Brazil, studies 
  in areas with optimum levels of fluoride in the water have not shown any impact 
  of dissatisfaction with the appearance of the teeth.<sup>19,20</sup> An investigation 
  among adolescents in Pelotas, Southern Brazil (with water fluoridated since 
  1962 and most cases of fluorosis in the very mild and mild categories) showed 
  a positive association between dental fluorosis and more favorable quality-of-life 
  scores.<sup>24</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bottled water may 
  also carry a risk of fluorosis. In the United Kingdom, the levels of fluoride 
  in 12 types of bottled water ranged from 0.1 to 0.8 mg F/l.<sup>30</sup> In 
  the Brazilian market, levels higher than 0.7 mg F/l were noted in 10.6% of 104 
  commercial brands of mineral water,<sup>34</sup> indicating a need for greater 
  control over manufactured mineral water products.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Occurrences of 
  cancer and bone fractures were not associated with water fluoridation.<sup>18</sup> 
  Skeletal fluorosis has been observed in areas with fluoride concentrations greater 
  than 5.6 mg F/l.<sup>7</sup> Systematic reviews have shown that i) medical prescriptions 
  of supplements containing fluoride may increase the bone mineral density of 
  the hip and spine, depending on the duration of use; no evidence was observed 
  in relation to the risk of hip or spine fracture and low doses of fluoride (20 
  mg per day or less) were associated with significant reductions in the risk 
  of fracture;<sup>33</sup> ii) although fluoride is capable of increasing the 
  bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine, it does not cause any reduction 
  in occurrences of vertebral fractures; increases in the fluoride dose may result 
  in a greater risk of non-spinal fractures and adverse gastrointestinal effects, 
  without any effect on the spinal fracture rate;<sup>13</sup> and iii) up to 
  1.0 mg F/l, there is no adverse effect regarding bone resistance, BMD and fracture 
  incidence.<sup>10</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, a high fluoride 
  concentration in water represents a risk of dental fluorosis for children with 
  dental enamel at the formation stage. The severity of the effect for the population 
  is related to the concentration present in the water. A 15% difference (95% 
  CI: 4.1; 27.2) in the prevalence of functionally significant fluorosis was found 
  when comparing areas with 1.0 mg F/l and 0.4 mg F/l in studies mainly involving 
  temperate-climate countries.<sup>18</sup></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>WATER POTABILITY 
  AND FLUORIDE CONCENTRATION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several countries 
  have specific recommendations relating to the fluoride parameter. In South America, 
  most countries have taken 1.5 mg F/l as the maximum permitted amount.<a name="toph"></a><a href="#backh"><sup>h</sup></a> 
  In the US, the Environmental Protection Agency has defined 4.0 mg F/l as the 
  maximum concentration level for fluoride in public water supply systems and 
  as the potability standard. However, there is a specific recommendation to adopt 
  a limit of 2.0 mg F/l to reduce the risk of dental fluorosis.<a name="topi"></a><a href="#backi"><sup>i</sup></a> 
  In Canada, water fluoridation decisions are made by each municipality. The Federal 
  Commission on Fluoridation recommends an optimum concentration of between 0.8 
  and 1.0 mg F/l. The Canadian government recommends an amount of 1.5 mg F/l as 
  the maximum acceptable concentration.<a name="topj"></a><a href="#backj"><sup>j</sup></a> 
  In European countries, the maximum permitted fluoride concentration in the water 
  supply is 1.5 mg F/l. Ireland has adopted specific legislation that is more 
  restrictive than the European law, limiting the concentration in the water supply 
  to 1.0 mg F/l.<a name="topk"></a><a href="#backk"><sup>k</sup></a> In Australia, 
  up to 1.5 mg F/l is accepted when it occurs naturally.<a href="#backl"><sup>l</sup></a> 
  In Asia, Hong Kong has reduced its optimum levels of fluoride added to the water 
  supply over recent years. Until 1978, the optimum level was 1.0 mg F/l, when 
  it was reduced to 0.7 mg F/l.<sup>11</sup> In 1988, the level was reduced to 
  0.5 mg F/l.<sup>15</sup> It needs to be highlighted that the mean maximum daily 
  temperature in the Hong Kong region is 24.7 &#176;C.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1984, WHO defined 
  1.5 mg F/l as the limit for safe potable water. This amount was reassessed in 
  the latest review<sup>37</sup> but was not adjusted due to the lack of reasonable 
  evidence. However, the WHO did emphasize that this amount should not be fixed 
  and it would dependent on the specific context.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Brazil, the 
  first federal standard was published in 1977, and the level of 1.7 mg F/l was 
  adopted as the criterion for the water potability standard. Currently, the level 
  of 1.5 mg F/l is used as the maximum permitted amount throughout the national 
  territory.<a href="#backd"><sup>d</sup></a> This level was established based 
  on technical reports from WHO, which served as the reference for many countries, 
  independent of their climatic conditions. It is emphasized in the standard that 
  "the recommended levels for the fluoride ion concentration should follow the 
  specific legislation in force relating to water fluoridation, while in any case 
  the maximum permitted amount of this Table shall be respected".<a href="#backd"><sup>d</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This text may lead 
  to the interpretation that the expression "in any case" refers both to naturally 
  occurring fluoride and fluoride added to the water for the purpose of dental 
  caries prevention, which is not justified in the context of the presented knowledge. 
  Thus, the maximum permitted amount for fluoride naturally present in water cannot 
  be used as the limit for fluoride added during water treatment.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It has been suggested 
  that the optimum fluoride concentration in water should be established by taking 
  into account not the air temperature but the dose to which children are exposed 
  (mg F/day/kg of body weight). Thus, Burt<sup>2</sup> suggested in 1992 that 
  a daily dose of 0.07 mg F per kg of body weight should be taken as the upper 
  limit, so that the resultant fluorosis would not compromise the anti-caries 
  benefits from fluoride intake among children within the at-risk age group. However, 
  this limit should be validated by data from a longitudinal dose-effect study, 
  and no association between the dose and the resultant fluorosis has been found<sup>16</sup>, 
  requiring more studies about a safety dose.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Based on the mean 
  maximum daily temperatures recorded in Brazilian state capitals only for 2008 
  (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2584t01.jpg">Table</a>), it is possible to calculate the 
  optimum fluoride concentration levels in accordance with the formula recommended 
  in Ordinance 635/75. This calculation shows a range from approximately 0.6 mg 
  F/l in Boa Vista, Northern Brazil, to 0.8 mg F/l in Curitiba, Southern Brazil. 
  Although records of daily air temperatures do not exist for all Brazilian municipalities, 
  it can be seen from the temperature characteristics in the different regions 
  that the appropriate fluoride levels recommended for most Brazilian municipalities 
  will be around this band (<a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2584t01.jpg">Table</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From consultations 
  in the electronic databases of state and municipal legislation, two states showed 
  complementary legislation. In the State of S&atilde;o Paulo, Resolution SS-65/2005 
  establishes that the water should contain 0.7 mg F/l, with acceptable variation 
  from 0.6 to 0.8 mg F/l.<a name="topm"></a><a href="#backm"><sup>m</sup></a> 
  In the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Ordinance SSMA 10/99 establishes that the 
  ideal fluoride concentration in water for human consumption is 0.8 mg F/l, with 
  acceptable variation from 0.6 to 0.9 mg F/l.<a name="topn"></a><a href="#backn"><sup>n</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Galagan and Vermillion<sup>12</sup> 
  made an important contribution towards applying the method through their proposed 
  formula for determining the optimum fluoride level, which considered the correlation 
  between fluid intake and the mean air temperature. It should be emphasized that 
  the optimum concentration was calculated based on temperature variations in 
  the US, which has a temperate climate. Hence, their formula may not be applicable 
  to regions with a tropical climate, for which a level of 0.5 mg F/l might be 
  considered appropriate.<sup>36</sup> In the case of Brazil, this is not a concern 
  for the southern and southeastern regions, where the climate is predominantly 
  subtropical,<sup>14</sup> but it may be so for cities in the northern, northeastern 
  and central-western regions, which have genuinely tropical climates.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>FINAL REMARKS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Based on the information 
  reviewed here, most countries have adopted the level of 1.5 mg F/l as the maximum 
  permitted amount for naturally occurring fluoride; Ireland, located to the north 
  of the Tropic of Cancer, and Hong Kong, located to the south of it, constitute 
  exceptions. In Australia, a country with climatic variation similar to that 
  of Brazil, the maximum permitted amount of 1.5 mg/l is explicitly adopted for 
  naturally occurring fluoride, and 1.0 mg F/l for areas where fluoride is added.<a href="#backl"><sup>l</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Brazil, the 
  optimum fluoride levels in treated water (with the maximum anti-caries benefit 
  and minimum risk of functionally significant dental fluorosis) for the state 
  capitals and Federal District ranged from 0.6 to 0.8 mg F/l. For some cities 
  in the south of the country, up to 0.9 mg F/l is accepted. As long as other 
  sources of drinking water or technologies of acceptable cost for adjusting or 
  removing fluoride from water remain unavailable, the maximum permitted amount 
  of 1.5 mg F/l can be accepted as a tolerable level in water for human consumption 
  in which the occurrence of fluoride is natural.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, in compliance 
  with Federal Decree 5440/2005,<a name="topo"></a><a href="#backo">º</a> when 
  the naturally occurring fluoride concentration is more than 0.9 mg F/l, the 
  entities responsible for the systems and alternative public water supply solutions 
  must furnish the following information to consumers: "This water should not 
  be consumed daily by children under the age of eight years", in conformity with 
  the current legislation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The percentage 
  of the Brazilian population supplied with naturally fluoridated water is unknown, 
  but a study covering 74% of the municipalities of the State of Piau&iacute; 
  (Northeastern Brazil) showed that although the concentration was low in 151 
  of them (&lt; 0.3 ppm F), 13 had levels of 0.31 to 0.59 mg F/l.<sup>29</sup> 
  Only one- third of the municipal sanitation services performed raw water analyses, 
  and such analyses were more common on water from surface catchment areas than 
  on underground aquifers.<a name="topp"></a><a href="#backp"><sup>p</sup></a> 
  Although the data available do not allow a panorama for the Brazilian population 
  to be outlined, it is estimated that there are few localities in the country 
  where naturally occurring fluoride reaches concentrations of 1.0 to 1.5 mg F/l.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The obligation 
  to provide information to the public stimulates public authorities at all levels 
  of government (federal, state and municipal), sanitation companies and other 
  interested parties to ensure that the naturally occurring fluoride concentrations 
  are close to optimum levels. This changing may occur over the medium to long 
  term, depending on local measures, but in many cases, measures of greater complexity 
  will be needed. These measures will involve agreements between different spheres 
  of government and the sanitation companies. This process, through specific legislation, 
  will constitute important support leading towards reviewing and defining the 
  quality standards for mineral water commercialized in Brazil.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In relation to 
  fluoride added to water, greater knowledge about the climatic conditions of 
  different regions of Brazil justifies the need to review Ordinance 635, which 
  was approved in 1975, in view of the expansion of the national program for water 
  fluoridation to places with a typically tropical climate.</font></p>
