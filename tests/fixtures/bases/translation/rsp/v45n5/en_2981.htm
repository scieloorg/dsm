<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The paper describes 
  the situation of road traffic accidents in Brazil since 1998, when a new Brazilian 
  traffic law was approved, up to the year 2010. A review of both academic and 
  non-academic literature was carried out, including journals (both indexed and 
  non-indexed), technical reports, author searches, searches in paper reference 
  lists and direct contact with researchers. The main problems related to road 
  traffic accidents in Brazil identified were the increase in the absolute number 
  of deaths and in the mortality rates, a rapid increase in the number of motorcycles, 
  and drink &amp; driving. Influent authors in the field and centers of expertise 
  were identified. Some potential solutions are presented by the authors, who 
  suggest that the public offices related to traffic regulation and control are 
  not taking suitable measures for control and reduction of road traffic accidents.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Around 1.2 million 
  people die worldwide from road traffic accidents (RTA) every year and more than 
  90% of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries.<a href="#backa">ª</a> 
  In addition to people's suffering from deaths and physical disabilities, RTA 
  also pose a heavy economic burden on health systems. The World Health Organization 
  (WHO) estimates that annual losses due to RTA exceed $500 billion.<a name="topb"></a><a href="#backb"><sup>b</sup></a> 
  In Brazil, the annual number of killed and severely injured people exceeds 150,000<a name="topc"></a><a href="#backc"><sup>c</sup></a> 
  and the Brazilian Institute of Applied Economic Research (IPEA) has estimated 
  that total RTA costs amount to R$ 28 billion per year.<a href="#backd"><sup>d</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="#backe"><sup>e</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brazil ranks high 
  among countries with the world's most dangerous roads and it has sought to reduce 
  the high number of accidents in recent years. After the implementation of the 
  new Brazilian Vehicle Code (BVC)<a href="#backf"><sup>f</sup></a> in 1998 RTA 
  mortality rate has remained stable (around 20 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants), 
  which is higher than the rates reported in Japan, Sweden and Canada (five to 
  eight deaths per 100,000).<a href="#backa">ª</a> New laws, local traffic control, 
  improved vehicle safety and increased electronic traffic monitoring has all 
  failed to significantly reduce deaths and disabilities.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This article aimed 
  to present a panorama of road traffic since the implementation of the new BVC.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In light of the 
  small number of scientific publications on RTA and low interaction between areas 
  such of knowledge such as epidemiology, engineering, psychology, medicine and 
  others, a descriptive review was conducted with extensive literature search. 
  This review study included scientific articles and publications in Portuguese, 
  English and Spanish published between 1998 and 2010 with data collected in Brazil 
  and that evaluated RTA as a primary or secondary outcome. There was conducted 
  a search of indexed journals in electronic databases, non-indexed journals, 
  technical reports, search by specific authors, reference lists of articles and 
  communications with researchers. The electronic search was conducted in MEDLINE 
  (National Library of Medicine), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health 
  Sciences), SciELO (Scientific Electronic Library Online) and Google Scholar 
  databases. It included the following descriptors: "traffic accidents", "road 
  accidents", "epidemiology" and "external causes". The descriptor "Brazil" was 
  added to restrict the search to publications in Brazil. There was no restriction 
  on demographic and socioeconomic factors and types of studies. The search for 
  articles was carried out between February and October 2010. Publications were 
  pre-selected based on their titles and abstracts. The full text of the publications 
  selected was obtained and examined. Brazilian websites such as the National 
  Traffic Department (Denatran), National Department of Transport and Infrastructure 
  (DNIT), Brazilian Federal Highway Authority (DPRF) and Brazilian Ministry of 
  Health Mortality Database (Datasus) were searched. Manual search for non-indexed 
  journals was also carried out at the Universidade Federal de Pelotas (UFPEL) 
  and Universidade Cat&oacute;lica de Pelotas (UCPEL) libraries.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The data here presented 
  follow the WHO 10th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases 
  and Related Health Problems (ICD-10).<a name="topg"></a><a href="#backg"><sup>g</sup></a> 
  Data on mortality and morbidity (hospital admission) between 1998 and 2005 was 
  obtained from the "Traffic Accidents in Brazil - An Atlas of their Distribution," 
  a publication of the Brazilian Traffic Medicine Association (ABRAMET).<a href="#backh"><sup>h</sup></a> 
  Data on mortality and morbidity between 2006 and 2008 was obtained from Datasus 
  database.<a name="topi"></a><a href="#backi"><sup>i</sup></a> The 2008 mortality 
  data are preliminary and morbidity data include the year of 2009. The DENATRAN<a href="#backj"><sup>j</sup></a> 
  provided information on the motor vehicle fleet.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DATA AND TRENDS 
  FROM 1998 TO 2008</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Law No. 9503 established 
  in 1998 -the first year of this review study-the new BVC.<a href="#backf"><sup>f</sup></a> 
  The new BVC was regarded as a promising action to reduce the growing number 
  of RTA and address this issue. It included stringent laws, higher fines and 
  chapters on traffic education in traffic. However, RTA mortality and hospital 
  admission rates remained the same or even increased.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By the end of 1998, 
  a total of 30,890 people died from RTA. It increased by 19% in 2008 (36,666 
  deaths) while the Brazilian population increased 17%. From 1998 to 2000 there 
  was a decrease in the fatality rate (28,995 deaths) but it increased steadily 
  in the following years, amounting to 37,407 deaths in 2007. The number of hospital 
  admissions resulting from RTA increased by 9%, from 108,988 in 1998 to 123,168 
  in 2009. It increased until 2000 (119,585), then fell from 2000 to 2003 (109.696), 
  increased from 2003 to 2006 (120,997) and then fell again in 2007. A peak and 
  a dip were seen during 2008 and 2009: a decline in 2008 (~95,000 hospital admissions), 
  followed by an increase by more than 30% (123,168) in 2009. This variation may 
  be explained by the impact of the National Prohibition Act (Law No. 11.705/08) 
  or errors in the database.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#f1">Figure 
  1</a> shows mortality rates from RTA with denominators commonly used in the 
  Brazilian scientific literature (deaths per 100,000 inhabitants and per 10,000 
  vehicles).</font></p>
<p><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2981f01.jpg"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The mortality rate 
  from RTA declined during the first two years of follow-up (from 19.1 deaths 
  per 100,000 in 1998 to 17.1 in 2000). There was a steady increase between 2001 
  and 2004, reaching 19.6 deaths per 100,000, which remained stable and close 
  to 20 deaths per 100,000 in subsequent years. The RTA mortality rate per vehicles 
  remained stable (around 10 deaths per 100,000 vehicles) until 2002. From 2003 
  to 2008 there was a slow decrease, 6.7 deaths per 100,000. This decrease may 
  be explained by an 85% increase of the Brazilian vehicle fleet, from 29.5 million 
  vehicles to over 54 million.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="/img/revistas/rsp/v45n5/en_2981f02.jpg">Figure 
  2</a> shows RTA according to categories of victims. "Other" included occupants 
  of three-wheeled motor vehicle, heavy vehicles (trucks), and buses, other road 
  accidents and unspecified road accidents. The category "Car occupants" included 
  occupants of vans.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In "Other" category 
  there were approximately 14,500 deaths in the beginning of the study period, 
  accounting for 45% of all deaths. After a steady decline, there were seen 9,603 
  deaths in 2008, just over 26%. This decrease may be resulting from improved 
  data quality as it also included unspecified road accidents.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There was a 12% 
  reduction in relative pedestrian deaths (36% in 1998 to 24% in 2008). However, 
  the number of deaths remained quite constant (from 9,000 to 10,000 deaths/year).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Deaths of car occupants 
  accounted for 22% of total deaths in 2008 compared to 12% in 1998. The number 
  of fatalities increased by 121% (from 3,736 to 8,093 deaths), being higher in 
  2007 (8,273 deaths).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fatalities among 
  motorcycle drivers and passengers increased over 700% during 1998-2008 (from 
  1,028 to 8,529 deaths). Motorcyclist deaths rose from 3% to 23% of all deaths 
  and cyclist fatalities increased from 1% (396 deaths) to 4% (1,556 deaths), 
  being higher in 2006 (1,668 deaths).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Similar to other 
  countries, Brazilian males died more from RTA than females (approximately 4.5 
  male: female). There was a reduction of RTA mortality rate among males from 
  1998 to 2000, reaching the lowest rate of the study period (28 deaths per 100,000 
  males) (<a href="#f3">Figure 3</a>). After a steady rise, it reached 33 deaths 
  per 100,000 in 2007. Among females, after a decline between 1998 and 2000, it 
  remained stable at seven deaths per 100,000.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>MOTORCYCLES</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Motorcycles have 
  taken up urban spaces as an efficient means of transportation and work to avoid 
  traffic congestion in large cities. Deficient public transport, the growing 
  delivery service industry, the possibility of generating income for unskilled 
  young people and ease of purchasing a motorcycle have all lead to a 5-fold increase 
  in motorcycle fleet compared to car fleet. There are more than 14 million circulating 
  motorcycles, accounting for 25% of the national fleet.<a name="topj"></a><a href="#backj"><sup>j</sup></a> 
  The motorcycle has become the most popular single means of transportation in 
  Brazil.<sup>36</sup> But careless riding and increased vulnerability of the 
  driver and passenger have led to an increase in the number of accidents involving 
  motorcyclists, especially young males, <sup>2,9,42,61</sup> and their main victims, 
  pedestrians.<sup>9,61,</sup><a href="#backk"><sup>k</sup></a> Motorcycle drivers 
  are a priority group in prevention programs<sup>9,11,59</sup> because they are 
  seven times more at risk of dying, four times more likely of being injured and 
  two times more likely to hit a pedestrian compared to car drivers.<sup>9</sup> 
  Pedestrians were historically the main victims of road accidents but now they 
  involve mainly motorcyclists.<sup>2,9,11,59</sup> In four large urban centers 
  (Bel&eacute;m in the northern state of Par&aacute;, Recife in the northeastern 
  state of Pernambuco, S&atilde;o Paulo in the southeastern state of S&atilde;o 
  Paulo and Porto Alegre in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul), 7% of all 
  car accidents involved victims while this proportion ranged from 61% to 82% 
  in motorcycle accidents.<a href="#backd"><sup>d</sup></a> The cost of RTA involving 
  motorcyclists was estimated at R$ 5.3 billions between 1998 and 2006, R$ 1,400.00 
  per circulating motorcycle.<a href="#backk"><sup>k</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Motorcycle courier 
  and motorcycle taxi driver have become regulated professions under Law No. 12,009 
  of 29 July 2009 requiring a minimum age of 21 years, a two-year driver's license 
  in this category and specialized training. Most drivers are young adult males.<sup>32,64</sup> 
  The motorcycle as a means of work is regarded as a potential factor for increased 
  motorcycle casualties,<sup>2,9,11,59</sup> and motorcycle couriers are at high 
  risk of RTA due to their job demands.<sup>19,36,64,73</sup> In S&atilde;o Paulo<a href="#backk"><sup>k</sup></a> 
  and Porto Alegre<sup>74</sup> 37% of deaths and 28% of emergency hospital admissions 
  of motorcyclists were among motorcycle couriers. Pressure from customers and 
  employers for fast deliveries,<sup>19,73</sup> pay on the basis of productivity 
  and daily work shifts exceeding 10 hours<sup>19,64</sup> have been identified 
  as determinants of inappropriate driving. Increased productivity is a justification 
  for their disrespect for traffic laws.<sup>19,32,65,73</sup> Typical behaviors 
  of young males including boldness, immaturity, a sense of invulnerability, a 
  tendency to overestimate their abilities and driving inexperience allied to 
  the need to become part of a group make them push the limits and transgress 
  them,<sup>1</sup> which makes it more complex the issue of RTA. The executive 
  veto of BVC Article 56 that prohibited driving between the lanes of traffic 
  on the grounds of offering "greater flexibility of movement" further jeopardizes 
  the safety of road users.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The expanding market 
  of delivery services and motorcycle taxis indicates that these workers' job 
  is demanded in our society. A qualitative study conducted in Porto Alegre showed 
  the social dichotomy involving motorcycle couriers: while they are discriminated 
  as drivers, their services are needed for fast deliveries.<sup>73</sup> This 
  pressure -recognizably a causing factor for traffic accidents- is key to secure 
  their jobs and is encouraged by employers and clients.<sup>65</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Diniz et al<sup>19</sup> 
  have suggested the work reality of these workers outgrows the thrill of riding 
  a motorcycle. They often have to cope with poor work conditions, lack of formal 
  contracts, long working hours, stress, psychological pressure for greater productivity, 
  low income and high risk of accidents. Motorcycle couriers live with the dialectic 
  of risk-need as described by Veronese &amp; Oliveira:<sup>73</sup> "To work 
  at risk of an RTA or not to work, that's the question. All that motorcycle couriers 
  can do is to manage the risk."</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The phenomenon 
  of motorcycle couriers is a major issue for traffic authorities in Brazil.<sup>14</sup> 
  Some actions have been pointed as critical for reducing RTA. Employers and clients 
  have to take part of this responsibility, reducing their demands for deliveries 
  that involve unsafe behaviors and extenuating working hours.<sup>32,73</sup> 
  Companies must be required to hire professional motorcycle couriers who have 
  been trained on defensive driving and use of safety equipment, in addition to 
  greater motorcycle inspection and use of speed control devices.<sup>32,73</sup> 
  However, a new debate on BVC Article 56<sup>14</sup> and targeted actions to 
  promote motorcycle courier behavior change<sup>73</sup> are unlikely to be effective. 
  Vasconcellos said the motorcycle-related deaths have cancelled out the gains 
  achieved with BVC in reducing RTA by other vehicles.<a href="#backk"><sup>k</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The motorcycle 
  has definitely a social role, either at work, for commuting or during leisure 
  time, and occupies 82% less public space than cars.<sup>63</sup> Its new status 
  is part of an irreversible change of the motor vehicle fleet composition.<sup>36</sup> 
  The challenge is to ensure safety of road users.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>DRINKING AND 
  DRIVING</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The association 
  of alcohol and RTA has been well documented in the literature. It is a major 
  cause of morbidity and mortality affecting mostly young males.<a name="topl"></a><a href="#backl"><sup>l</sup></a> 
  The First Household Survey on Patterns of Alcohol Consumption conducted in 143 
  Brazilian cities in 2009 showed a 35% prevalence of drinking and driving (43% 
  among men and 9% among women).<sup>54</sup> Studies carried out in S&atilde;o 
  Paulo, the Federal District, and Porto Alegre between 2005 and 2009 on the association 
  between alcohol use and related deaths found blood alcohol contents (BAC) in 
  45%, 43% and 32% of cases, respectively.<sup>30,49,</sup><a name="topm"></a><a href="#backm"><sup>m</sup></a> 
  Among non-fatal injuries treated at trauma care centers and emergency rooms 
  in S&atilde;o Paulo and Uberl&acirc;ndia (southeastern state of Minas Gerais), 
  the prevalence of alcohol use was 24% and 29%, respectively,<sup>24,27</sup> 
  Alcohol use was suspected in nearly 17% of RTA cases seen at emergency services 
  in the cities covered by the Sentinel Surveillance System on Violence and Injuries.<sup>37</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under the 1998 
  BVC driving under the influence of alcohol (BAC <u>></u>0.6 grams of alcohol 
  per liter of blood) is a criminal offense. Law No. 11,705 that went into effect 
  on June 20, 2008 changed blood alcohol limit for drivers to zero (with a tolerance 
  of up to 0.2 g/L) punishable with more strict penalties up to imprisonment in 
  <i>flagrante delicto</i> if BAC &gt;0.6 g/L. Few studies have assessed the effectiveness 
  of the Prohibition Act or Zero Tolerance law. Mello Jorge &amp; Koizumi<sup>47</sup> 
  found 28% reduction in hospital admissions between the two halves of 2008, as 
  well as significantly reduced hospital stay (42%), hospital costs (39.2%) and 
  mortality (13.6%). In the city of S&atilde;o Paulo, there was a 48% to 36% reduction 
  in BAC in fatal injuries when compared data from the second half of 2007 and 
  2008.<sup>28</sup> Despite not having been based on a time series that could 
  support or refute the findings, the results suggest that the new law was effective.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moura et al<sup>50</sup> 
  monitored through phone calls the frequency adults drove after using alcohol 
  in 27 Brazilian cities. They found a decrease in the months immediately following 
  the enactment of the law but further increase was seen in the following months. 
  These studies, together with morbidity data from the Brazilian National Health 
  System Database (SIH-SUS), suggest that the Zero Tolerance law of 2008 was effective 
  in reducing alcohol-related RTA for a limited period.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The city of Porto 
  Alegre passed a law against alcohol consumption at gas stations in 2006. De 
  Boni et al<sup>17</sup> showed no difference in BAC among groups of young patrons 
  pre- and post-law enforcement. Studies using breathalyzers to estimate BAC at 
  sobriety checkpoints on weekends showed very high prevalences in other two cities. 
  In the city of Belo Horizonte BAC was detected in 38% of drivers and was above 
  the legal limit in 20%.<sup>13</sup> In the city of Diadema, state of S&atilde;o 
  Paulo, the proportions were 24% and 19%, respectively, which are up to six times 
  higher than those reported in international studies.<sup>21</sup> A study conducted 
  post-law enforcement with individuals potentially at risk for alcohol-related 
  RTA found 51% with BAC and they intended to drive.<a href="#backn"><sup>n</sup></a> 
  Studies<sup>13,17,21,</sup><a href="#backn"><sup>n</sup></a> pointed deficient 
  oversight as a factor for failed law enforcement, in addition to high prevalence 
  of BAC. Pinsky et al<sup>56</sup> showed that 85% of young people applying for 
  a driver's license did not know anyone who has been legally punished for drinking 
  and driving, 74% believed that no offender would receive the statutory penalty 
  and 64% said it was very unlikely they would be stopped by police or subject 
  to penalties. A study conducted post-enforcement of the Zero Tolerance law found 
  that, while 86% of respondents said they had drunk and driven in the last year, 
  9% were stopped and asked to perform a breathalyzer test.<a href="#backn"><sup>n</sup></a> 
  Twenty percent of professional drivers working in Brazilian federal highways 
  said they had been asked to take the breathalyzer test while 9% and 8% of car 
  and motorcycle drivers were asked to do so, respectively. BAC was detected in 
  1% of bus drivers to up to 5% of truck drivers.<a href="#backo">º</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Souza et al<a name="topp"></a><a href="#backp"><sup>p</sup></a> 
  reported that 47% of RTA cost is related to excess alcohol use in Porto Alegre. 
  Mello Jorge &amp; Koizumi<sup>47</sup> showed 28% reduction in hospital admissions 
  and 36% cost reduction with a public saving of more than R$ 23 million after 
  the enforcement of Zero Tolerance law. They stressed this law has saved lives 
  since it came into force.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The negligence 
  of state authorities with inadequate oversight can kill thousands of people 
  each year.<sup>13,17,21,</sup><a href="#backo">º</a> The Zero Tolerance law 
  would not be required if there were effective oversight and enforcement of the 
  previous law. Countries with low RTA mortality rates (&lt;8 deaths per 100,000)

  Japan,0.5 g/L in France, 0.5 g/L in Germany, 0.5 g/L in the Netherlands, 0.8 
  g/L in England, and 0.8 g/L in Canada.<a href="#backa">ª</a> They all have strict

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pedestrians account 
  for almost one-third of deaths from RTA in Brazil (approximately 10,000 deaths 
  per year) and an increasing number of deaths are seen among cyclists (over 1,500 
  in 2005).<a href="#backh"><sup>h</sup></a> Pedestrians are the third largest 
  group of victims, following motorcyclists and car occupants in southern Brazil, 
  but they are the leading group in casualties (38% of deaths and 11% mortality 
  rate).<sup>9</sup> There is high underreporting of RTA in pedestrians and cyclists, 
  53% and 33%, respectively, with a corrected mortality rate of 5%, the highest 
  for both groups. Among injured pedestrians 70% were children or elderly.<sup>9</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the city of 
  Maring&aacute;, southern state of Paran&aacute;,<sup>68</sup> pedestrians and 
  cyclists had a 119% and 65% higher risk of RTA hospital admission, respectively, 
  compared to car occupants. In 1998, 47% of the deaths occurred in pedestrians 
  and cyclists<sup>62</sup> and almost 90% of deaths in elderly (65 years or more) 
  were caused by run overs. Andrade &amp; Mello Jorge<sup>2</sup> found that even 
  if pedestrians are 12% of total RTA in Londrina, southern state of Paran&aacute;, 
  they account for almost one-third of the deaths and have the highest rates of 
  hospital admission (18%) and mortality (5%). Soares &amp; Soares study<sup>67</sup> 
  showed that children and elderly are the main groups of injured pedestrians, 
  with high rates of RTA incidence and mortality among the elderly (256 and 44 
  per 100,000, respectively). Pedestrians accounted for 42% while cyclists accounted 
  for 15% of RTA deaths in the city of Fortaleza, northeastern state of Cear&aacute;, 
  in 2001-2002, These two groups accounted for 38% of all injuries.<sup>16</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The elderly are 
  the main injured group among pedestrians. Gawryszewski et al<sup>26</sup> pointed 
  RTA as a leading cause of death from external causes in this group, half of 
  them occurring by run overs. In the city of Ribeir&atilde;o Preto, southeastern 
  state of S&atilde;o Paulo, 41% of RTA in individuals over 60 were in pedestrians, 
  of which 60% had sequelae due to their injuries, and 12% were cyclists.<sup>66</sup> 
  About 52% of the elderly injured were pedestrians and 13% were cyclists.<sup>71</sup> 
  They were all able to perform daily activities before but RTA have prevented 
  them from their activities causing serious financial difficulties. The authors 
  noted the importance of the elderly in society: many work in the community, 
  care for relatives, support their families, work and consume goods and services. 
  In the city of Londrina, of 121 elderly who were injured and treated in hospitals, 
  9% died and the main underlying cause was run over. According to the families, 
  the elderly were totally independent before they were injured.<sup>12</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Similar to the 
  elderly, child pedestrians are frequently injured. There were more than 1,000 
  deaths per year due to run overs in children under 15 years between 2000 and 
  2005 (2.2 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants).<sup>15</sup> The male-to-female ratio 
  was 1.8:1 and the most affected age group was five to nine. Because of poor 
  data quality or run away from the accident scene 83% of reports did not specify 
  the causing vehicle in 2000, decreasing to 70% in 2005. Among the vehicles specified, 
  there was a higher proportion of passenger vehicles, and the highest number 
  of deaths occurred in pedestrians under 15 when compared to other RTA in this 
  age group (64% in 2000 and 67% in 2005). In the city of Uberl&acirc;ndia, 46% 
  of injured victims from zero to 14 years of age<sup>25</sup> were cyclists and 
  31% pedestrians. Among the most severely injured (admission to an intensive 
  care unit), 81% were pedestrians and 7% cyclists. Two-thirds of deaths occurred 
  in pedestrians. The large proportion of RTA involving bikes can be possibly 
  explained by the fact that they are commonly used for recreation in the flat, 
  sunny streets of Uberl&acirc;ndia. In Londrina, most injured people were cyclists 
  (66%) and pedestrians (20%) and the rates of hospital admission were 38% and 
  35%, respectively. Of eight deaths reported, five were pedestrians and two cyclists.<sup>35</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With an estimated 
  fleet of 75 million units, bikes are the main means of transportation among 
  workers in Brazil.<sup>s</sup> In the city of Pelotas, southern state of Rio 
  Grande do Sul, 17% of the working population use bikes for daily commute. It 
  is the main means of transportation among men (27%).<sup>6</sup> Over a 12-month 
  period, 6% of cyclists have suffered some RTA during work commute, a proportion 
  that is higher than that reported in official local data. In Maring&aacute;, 
  cyclists accounted for 18% of deaths from RTA in 1992. The use of bikes as a 
  means of transportation is common in Brazilian inner cities with mild temperatures 
  and flat topography, and is an economic means especially among lower income 
  population.<sup>62</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most studies have 
  recommended measures to reduce RTA in pedestrians and cyclists, from the reassessment 
  of public policies that encourage one-person-per-car commute<sup>2</sup> to 
  the design of more friendly public spaces to pedestrians especially children 
  and elderly.<sup>2,15,68</sup> The main recommendations include creating safe 
  spaces for recreation,<sup>35</sup> educational programs for drivers<sup>15,66</sup> 
  children, parents<sup>15</sup> and the elderly.<sup>66</sup> Faria &amp; Braga<sup>22</sup> 
  (1999) proposed a program of actions to reduce the risk of RTA involving children 
  and adolescents, especially pedestrians. These recommendations included assessment 
  of routes of circulation, traffic engineering and educational activities at 
  pedestrian crossings, improved monitoring and a new proposal for traffic education.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The creation of 
  exclusive spaces for bicycle travel (bicycle paths and lanes) is the main recommendation 
  for increasing the safety of cyclists,<sup>6,8,35,62</sup> besides increasing 
  public awareness about traffic rules.<sup>6</sup> Studies conducted in Pelotas 
  have shown that behavior change of cyclists and educational interventions will 
  not have a significant impact on reducing RTA in the city.<sup>7,8</sup></font></p>

  accidents involving trucks and freight vehicles on federal highways increased 
  14%, from 40,107 to 45,833 with 3,124 deaths and more than 20,000 injured.<a href="#backu"><sup>u</sup></a> 
  In the United States 25 truck drivers per 10,000 die in road accidents every 
  year compared to 281 per 10,000 in Brazil.<sup>14</sup> Truck drivers fall into 
  two categories: employees of truckload services companies with better work conditions 
  and safety, and self-employed.<sup>14</sup> In addition to their stressful job, 
  self-employed truck drivers have to deal with low pay, little or no training, 
  great pressure to deliver their freight on time, and excess workload.<sup>14</sup> 
  However, the association with RTA cannot be verified due to a lack of scientific 
  publications on these workers working on the Brazilian highway system. However, 
  there few studies on sleep disorders, use of amphetamines and alcohol among 
  professional truck drivers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Studies with truck 
  drivers at gas stations and roadside restaurants showed that two-thirds would 
  drive nine hours or more per day, 50% of them over 12 hours a day.<sup>52</sup> 
  Another study showed 43% of truck drivers would drive more than 16 hours a day.<sup>70</sup> 
  This work routine is associated with high prevalences of excessive daytime sleepiness 
  (32%<sup>70</sup> to 46%<sup>55</sup>) and RTA. Many truck drivers use amphetamines 
  to reduce their fatigue on long journeys. Nascimento et al<sup>52</sup> reported 
  that two-thirds of truck drivers use amphetamines: 27% reported daily use and 
  60% reported using it two to three times a week. Most (76%) reported using it 
  to get to their destination in less time and 27% reported road accidents associated 
  to its use. Amphetamines are purchased at gas stations (58%), drugstores (38%), 
  and in their truck companies (8%). Nearly half of truck companies in the southern 
  state of Santa Catarina reported drug use by drivers in 2004; 65% of them reported 
  amphetamine use. Most reported RTA causing deaths or permanent disabilities.<sup>77</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A study showed

  24% of them reported daily use. Forty-three percent of drivers reported gas

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There were found 
  no studies on RTA associated with passenger transportation. Data from the Federal

  of these issues would allow the implementation of actions aimed at changing 
  the current panorama of road traffic in Brazil.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RTA data come from 
  three main data sources: police reports, SIH-SUS and Mortality Database (SIM). 
  Data from these sources are not fully complete and accurate and are neither 
  complementary nor interconnected.<sup>43</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The police report 
  is a record of RTA filed at civil police and civil-military federal highway 
  authority stations. This is not a standard record systematized at the national 
  level.<sup>43</sup> Studies with police reports have demonstrated significant 
  underreporting of RTA and deaths. Barros et al<sup>9</sup> verified that 39% 
  of RTA in Pelotas were underreported, varying according to the category of the 
  victim, type of injury and time of occurrence. Andrade &amp; Mello Jorge<sup>3</sup> 
  reported only 33% of police reports compared to records of emergency room and 
  hospital admissions and death certificates in Londrina. Police report coverage 
  was 72% of accidents involving car occupants and 8% and 25% of those involving 
  cyclists and pedestrians, respectively. These authors have argued that police 
  reports can provide major information on RTA that is crucial for the development 
  of prevention actions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although SIH-SUS 
  includes only data from hospital admissions paid by the Brazilian National Health 
  System (SUS), these data are regularly updated and readily available.<sup>58</sup> 
  All information is collected from hospital admission authorizations (AIH). The 
  AIH form has been modified in 1998 to include a required specific field to code 
  "secondary diagnosis" or injury morbidity data from external causes. A 2008 
  study assessed the quality of AIH data by comparing the coding of primary and 
  secondary diagnoses in SIH-SUS and medical records.<sup>41</sup> RTA accounted 
  for 32% of hospital admissions showing an optimal level of agreement (kappa 
  = 0.90). But hospital admissions due to external causes coded as natural causes 
  in the database were not included in the study. Tomimatsu et al<sup>72</sup> 
  assessed coverage and quality of hospital admission information in Londrina 
  and Maring&aacute; based on AIH medical reports. In Londrina there was high 
  underreporting of RTA with an increase in the number of hospital admissions 
  to 988 from 492 after reclassification. They also found underreporting of hospital 
  admissions due to external causes (41% in Londrina and 25% in Maring&aacute;). 
  Researchers have argued that low appreciation and use of epidemiological information 
  in the medical curricula could explain data underreporting. It is being implemented 
  an intervention study that proposes awareness-raising actions and training of 
  doctors and hospital coders on the importance of proper reporting of information 
  in SUS-affiliated hospitals.<sup>4</sup></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Death certificates 
  are SIM core data form. For deaths from external causes, a death certificate 
  is completed by medical examiners at Institutes of Forensic Medicine (IMLs) 
  who is ethically and legally responsible for providing complete death certificates 
  according to the Brazilian Ministry of Health.<a name="topv"></a><a href="#backv"><sup>v</sup></a> 
  Unlike police reports, deaths are recorded in the SIM regardless of the time 
  between the RTA and death, resulting in inconsistent data.<sup>43</sup> ICD-10 
  allows to include information on RTA victim category (pedestrian, cyclist, motorcyclist, 
  and others) and characteristics. A study with death certificate data collected 
  in 1996 following the implementation of ICD-10 in Brazil showed that RTA was 
  not reported as a cause of death in about 35% of deaths and 20% of death certificates 
  did not include information on the category of victim.<sup>3</sup> Limited knowledge 
  and/or low motivation of health providers could explain inadequate quality of 
  data. Also in 1996, Drumond Jr. et al<sup>20</sup> found that the type of accident 
  could be identified in 53% of deaths from police reports sent with the bodies, 
  and 33% were RTA suggesting that IMLs do not use information available at their 
  own institute. A study carried out in 15 Brazilian cities based on data from 
  IMLs, police stations and victim's homes showed an increase by 90% of RTA deaths 
  compared to that reported in death certificates only.<sup>44</sup> The authors 
  argued that IMLs have data that allow to identify the cause of death but they 
  are not included in death certificates. Jorge Mello et al have suggested there 
  is a need to focus on the search for information, which is usually available 
  but have to be retrieved.<sup>46</sup> Matos et al<sup>38</sup> identified 83% 
  of the 70 deaths classified as "unspecified injury" by combining IML and SIM 
  data from the Municipal Health Department of Belo Horizonte, and 41% were RTA-related. 
  The cause of death was identified in 71% of events of undetermined intent, and 
  RTA were the most common cause, resulting in a 6% increase in deaths from run 
  overs and 33% from car accidents. This study suggests the need to improve coding 
  and selection of underlying cause, death certificate completion and quality 
  of police and medical information. In the city of S&atilde;o Jose dos Campos, 
  southeastern state of S&atilde;o Paulo, missing information on death certificates 
  prevented the estimate of mortality rates by type of victim. Unspecified RTA 
  was recorded in 57% to 70% of death certificates.<sup>39</sup> A study in the 
  state Paran&aacute; using SIM data showed a reduction in the proportion of deaths 
  due to events of undetermined intent, 22% in 1980 to 2% in 2005.<sup>33</sup> 
  The reduction of 15 deaths per 100,000 during the triennium 1979-1981 to two 
  deaths in 2003-2005 suggests improved quality of records as a result of local 
  data processing (1993) and systematic training of technical coders. According 
  to Jorge Mello et al,<sup>46</sup> SIM has greatly improved coverage and quality 
  of data and is expected to have a coverage close to 100%. There is a need to 
  encourage, raise awareness and guide managers, conduct research and learn from 
  successful experiences to improve quality of data.</font></p>

  managers, program implementation staff, users, among others, and field observations). 
  PRMMAT implementation in the five cities studied occurred at different time 
  points from October 2003 to August 2004. The authors pointed out weaknesses 
  including lack of familiarity with intersectoral work; poor visibility of RTA 
  as a problem; frequent changes in coordination; and political interference in 
  the program projects. The strengths included the experience of local departments 
  in dealing with RTA; the process of intersectoral coordination; raising public 
  awareness on RTA; and the production of a set of indicators and methods for 
  program evaluation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>CONCLUSIONS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although scientific 
  production on RTA is still modest in Brazil, there was a 450% growth in publications 
  during the review period, from 22 until 1997 to 100 from 1998 to 2010 (using 
  the descriptor "traffic accidents" in the SciELO database). It is of note focal 
  points of knowledge production and leading authors in the areas studied, particularly 
  the production of an atlas of RTA distribution in Brazil.<a href="#backh"><sup>h</sup></a> 
  However, there are gaps in RTA research in Brazil including ongoing studies 
  on accidents and traffic flow on highways, use of more reliable denominators 
  for risk comparison (e.g., per mileage traveled) and assessment of intervention 
  effectiveness.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brazil is off track 
  in the fight against RTA which is evidenced by a growing number of deaths and 
  sustained high mortality and hospital admission rates. The BVC had at its implementation 
  the required legal framework to produce an effective reduction of RTA. Over 
  the years factors including modern electronic data systems, improved technologies 
  (breathalyzers, radars, and electronic speed control devices), improved vehicle 
  safety, and development of traffic engineering and pre-hospital emergency services 
  have all contributed to increase its effectiveness. In addition, several cities 
  have invested in traffic safety, highways were privatized and properly maintained 
  and the media has given due visibility to the problem helping to raise public 
  awareness.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The process of 
  reducing RTA has been hindered by several actions, or lack of actions, including 
  the requirement to warn the public on the location of traffic control devices, 
  veto of a law prohibiting motorcycles to ride between lanes of traffic, reduced 
  penalties and payment of fines in installments, non-implementation of a traffic 
  education and mild restrictions on advertising related to drinking and driving, 
  among others.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Marin &amp; Queiroz 
  (2000)<sup>34</sup> stressed that state authorities shall have the responsibility 
  for the implementation of effective public policies and law enforcement. The 
  original BVC and most recently Law No. 11,705/08 have constituted legal advancements. 
  Yet, public policies and law enforcement lacked strength with minor actions 
  or actions limited to short periods after their implementation. Studies on the 
  implementation of the new BVC have emphasized that strict law enforcement and 
  punitive measures may be effective in reducing traffic accidents<sup>10,23</sup> 
  and increasing traffic safety practices.<sup>31</sup> Andrade et al<sup>5</sup> 
  demonstrated that the greatest impact on RTA mortality reduction observed from 
  1994 to 2005 was a result of the implementation of the new BVC. But there were 
  no major advances in reducing mortality after 1999, possibly due to loosening 
  law enforcement and penalties provided for under the new code.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Studies that have 
  shown RTA reduction after implementation of BVC and Law No. 11,705/08 suggest 
  that state authorities have the power to reduce a great deal of accidents and 
  save lives. It is key to have ongoing vigorous actions. Educational actions 
  are also important and should be widely implemented, but they are not effective 
  as a single measure.<sup>53</sup> Improvements in public transport, investment 
  in alternative healthier means of transport such as bikes and promotion of rational 
  use of private cars are essential to improve quality of life in cities and reduce 
  traffic accidents.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The significant 
  increase in the car and motorcycle fleet fueled by low interest loans and economic 
  growth and coupled with the rapid population aging are enormous challenges to 
  the current national traffic policy. In 2004 RTAs were the ninth major cause 
  of death worldwide with 1.2 million victims. The WHO estimates that RTA will 
  be the fifth leading cause of death in 2030, killing more than 2 million people.<a href="#backa">ª</a> 
  The way Brazil will address this issue can either help reduce this burden or 
  confirm this prediction.</font></p>
